# Agent Fleet Management Dashboard

> The missing operating system for AI agents. Observability, cost tracking, security auditing, and orchestration in one platform.

## The Problem

Pat Walls (@thepatwalls) spent 4-5 hours trying to get OpenClaw working and hit a wall:
> "If it's doing something in the background, or working on a longer-term project, I should at least be able to see this somewhere and maybe get some insights into what it's doing."

**Every person running agentic AI tools is flying blind.**

## The Solution

A unified dashboard for managing AI agent fleets — think Datadog meets Linear for AI agents.

## Core Features

### 🔍 Observability
- Real-time agent activity feed
- Session history and replay
- File change tracking
- API call logging
- Error monitoring and alerting

### 💰 Cost Management
- Multi-provider cost tracking (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.)
- Token usage by agent/task
- Budget alerts and forecasting
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Team spending controls

### 🔒 Security & Compliance
- Agent permission auditing
- Sensitive data access monitoring
- Security policy enforcement
- Compliance reporting (SOC2, GDPR)
- Integration with Opportunity #3 (Security Scanner)

### 🎛️ Orchestration
- Multi-agent workflow designer
- Task queue management
- Human-in-the-loop approvals
- Agent performance comparison
- A/B testing for agent configurations

### 📦 Template Hub
- Share and discover agent configurations
- Community-rated templates
- Framework-specific setups (React, Python, Rails)
- Integration with Opportunity #5 (Claude Code Configs)

## Architecture

```
Agent Fleet Dashboard
├── Agent SDK (install in your agents)
├── Dashboard UI (web interface)
├── API Layer (REST + WebSocket)
├── Data Pipeline (metrics, logs, events)
└── Integration Hub (plugins for tools)
```

## Integrations

**Built-in integrations with other opportunities:**
- Opportunity #2: AI Subscription Cost Aggregator → Cost Management module
- Opportunity #3: AI Agent Security Scanner → Security & Compliance module
- Opportunity #5: Claude Code Reliability Templates → Template Hub
- Opportunity #7: MCP Dashboard Components → UI component library

## Monetization

**Free Tier**
- 3 agents monitored
- 7-day data retention
- Basic observability
- Community templates

**Pro Tier ($49/month)**
- Unlimited agents
- 90-day data retention
- Cost tracking & optimization
- Security auditing
- Team collaboration

**Enterprise ($499/month)**
- Unlimited everything
- Custom data retention
- SLA & dedicated support
- On-premise deployment option
- Custom integrations

## Why This Is The Platform Play

Every other opportunity plugs into it:
- **Cost tracking** → Cost Management module
- **Security auditing** → Security & Compliance module
- **Model comparison** → Agent Performance analytics
- **Template sharing** → Template Hub
- **Voice integration** → Agent capabilities tracking
- **Content verification** → Audit logging
- **MCP components** → Dashboard UI library

**This becomes the operating system for the agent economy.**

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Month 1): Observability**
- Agent SDK
- Real-time activity feed
- Session replay
- Basic dashboard

**Phase 2 (Month 2): Cost & Security**
- Multi-provider cost tracking
- Token usage analytics
- Security audit logs
- Policy enforcement

**Phase 3 (Month 3): Orchestration**
- Workflow designer
- Task queues
- Human approvals
- Agent comparison tools

**Phase 4 (Month 4): Platform**
- Template hub
- Plugin system
- API for third-party integrations
- Enterprise features

## Competitive Advantage

- **First-mover**: No unified agent management platform exists
- **Integrations**: Plays well with entire "agent ops" ecosystem
- **Network effects**: More agents = more data = better insights
- **Platform moat**: Becomes the default "agent OS"
