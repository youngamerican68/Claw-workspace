# Cursor General Rules

## Code Generation

- Generate complete, working code — not placeholders or TODOs
- Include proper error handling
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Follow existing code style in the file/project

## Before Editing

- Read the current file contents
- Understand the surrounding context
- Check for existing patterns or conventions
- Ask if requirements are unclear

## Testing

- Suggest tests for new functionality
- Run existing tests before and after changes
- Don't break existing tests without explicit permission

## Dependencies

- Don't add new npm packages without discussion
- Prefer native solutions when adequate
- Check package.json for existing dependencies

## Git

- Never commit without explicit permission
- Stage changes incrementally for review
- Write descriptive commit messages

## Communication

- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Provide alternatives when trade-offs exist
- Be concise but complete

## Safety

- Never delete files without confirmation
- Never push to production/main branches
- Never expose secrets or API keys
