/**
 * Represents descriptive (non-technical) metadata about a media file, such as title, author, date, cover art, or other
 * attached files. Common tags are normalized by Mediabunny into a uniform format, while the `raw` field can be used to
 * directly read or write the underlying metadata tags (which differ by format).
 *
 * - For MP4/QuickTime files, the metadata refers to the data in `'moov'`-level `'udta'` and `'meta'` atoms.
 * - For WebM/Matroska files, the metadata refers to the Tags and Attachments elements whose target is 50 (MOVIE).
 * - For MP3 files, the metadata refers to the ID3v2 or ID3v1 tags.
 * - For Ogg files, there is no global metadata so instead, the metadata refers to the combined metadata of all tracks,
 * in Vorbis-style comment headers.
 * - For WAVE files, the metadata refers to the chunks within the RIFF INFO chunk.
 * - For ADTS files, there is no metadata.
 * - For FLAC files, the metadata lives in Vorbis style in the Vorbis comment block.
 * - For MPEG-TS files, metadata tags are currently not supported.

     * The raw, underlying metadata tags.
     *
     * This field can be used for both reading and writing. When reading, it represents the original tags that were used
     * to derive the normalized fields, and any additional metadata that Mediabunny doesn't understand. When writing, it
     * can be used to set arbitrary metadata tags in the output file.
     *
     * The format of these tags differs per format:
     * - MP4/QuickTime: By default, the keys refer to the names of the individual atoms in the `'ilst'` atom inside the
     * `'meta'` atom, and the values are derived from the content of the `'data'` atom inside them. When a `'keys'` atom
     * is also used, then the keys reflect the keys specified there (such as `'com.apple.quicktime.version'`).
     * Additionally, any atoms within the `'udta'` atom are dumped into here, however with unknown internal format
     * (`Uint8Array`).
     * - WebM/Matroska: `SimpleTag` elements whose target is 50 (MOVIE), either containing string or `Uint8Array`
     * values. Additionally, all attached files (such as font files) are included here, where the key corresponds to
     * the FileUID and the value is an {@link AttachedFile}.
     * - MP3: The ID3v2 tags, or a single `'TAG'` key with the contents of the ID3v1 tag.
     * - Ogg: The key-value string pairs from the Vorbis-style comment header (see RFC 7845, Section 5.2).
     * Additionally, the `'vendor'` key refers to the vendor string within this header.
     * - WAVE: The individual metadata chunks within the RIFF INFO chunk. Values are always ISO 8859-1 strings.
     * - FLAC: The key-value string pairs from the vorbis metadata block (see RFC 9639, Section D.2.3).
     * Additionally, the `'vendor'` key refers to the vendor string within this header.
     * - MPEG-TS: Not supported.
