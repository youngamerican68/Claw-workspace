Tweet Thread: Why I Don't Vibe Code (And Neither Should You)
================================================================================

Tweet 1/7 - The Hook:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New UC San Diego study confirms what senior engineers already know:

"Vibe coding" — the "prompt, accept, ship" workflow — produces unmaintainable code and creates security nightmares.

Pros don't vibe code. They control.

Here's the difference 🧵

---

Tweet 2/7 - The Problem:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is "vibe coding"?

❌ Prompt AI with vague requirements
❌ Accept output without reading it
❌ Copy-paste into production
❌ Hope it works

The result? Technical debt that compounds faster than your crypto losses.

Tweet 3/7 - The Reality Check:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vibe-coded codebases have:

• Security vulnerabilities nobody understands
• "It works, don't touch it" functions
• Dependencies chosen by AI roulette
• Zero reproducibility

That "vibe" you feel? It's your future 3 AM production incident.

Tweet 4/7 - The Alternative:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pros use Agent-Driven Development:

✅ Structured tasks with clear requirements
✅ AI uses tools, not just memory
✅ Every step recorded & auditable
✅ Human approval for critical changes
✅ Tests verify everything

Control + augmentation > blind generation

Tweet 5/7 - The Philosophy:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI doesn't eliminate engineering — it changes how you apply it.

The best developers aren't better prompters.

They're better *judges*.

They know when to accept AI suggestions and when to reject them. They understand trade-offs AI can't see.

Tweet 6/7 - The Tool:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is why I built OpenClaw.

It's not an AI that replaces engineers.

It's an AI that *empowers* them — with structured workflows, tool augmentation, and full reproducibility.

You're the conductor. The AI plays the instruments.

Tweet 7/7 - The CTA:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stop vibe coding.
Start controlling.

Your future self (and your on-call rotation) will thank you.

Optional Follow-up Tweet (if engagement is high):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The hard truth:

If you can't explain what your AI-generated code does, you're not an engineer using AI.

You're a gambler using autocomplete.

Learn the difference before your code teaches you the hard way.

ENGAGEMENT TIPS:
- Post during peak dev hours (9-11am PT or 1-3pm PT)
- Pin the thread to your profile
- Consider creating a visual summary image
- Reply to comments with specific examples
- Quote tweet with your own experiences
