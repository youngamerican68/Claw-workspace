## Critical Learnings

### Autonomous Execution Expectation
Paul expects me to build autonomously from scout reports without waiting for prompts. The "Overnight Employee" concept means:
- Build while he sleeps
- Don't ask "what's next?" - just execute
- Ship landing pages immediately from scout signals
- Create PRs, never push live without review

### Technical Lessons
1. **File truncation is real** - Always verify files end properly with closing tags
2. **Use skills when appropriate** - Don't default to manual work when skills exist (frontend-design, remotion-best-practices)
3. **Subagents need correct paths** - Give exact file paths, don't assume they'll find things
4. **Remotion setup** - Use existing templates from video-promo/assets/remotion-template, don't start from scratch

### Workflow Locked In
- Scout report arrives → Single delivery (no splits for Vercel dashboard)
- Identify 2-3 🔴 BUILD NOW opportunities immediately  
- Spawn subagents OR build directly - don't wait
- Deploy to /var/www/previews/ → Update dashboard → Commit to git
- Paul wakes up to shipped builds

### Dashboard Separation
- **Vercel dashboard** (twitter-scout-tracker): Gets data from Telegram messages automatically
- **Landing page dashboard** (/var/www/previews/): Static HTML I control directly
- Two different systems, update accordingly

### Design Permission
"Break the rules" pass granted - can violate one design criterion if it makes output stronger. Bold aesthetics, distinctive choices, no generic AI slop.

### Paul's Context
- Location: Bucks County, PA (EST/EDT)
- Values: Transparency, directness, execution over discussion
- Frustration triggers: Waiting for prompts, talking instead of building, making excuses
- Preferred outcome: Ships in morning without asking

## Key Decisions

1. **Landing pages from Feb 11 morning scout**: AI Safety Transparency, Video Infrastructure, SaaS Infrastructure - all deployed and committed
2. **Remotion pivot**: Attempted Remotion for video landing pages, hit server limitations, pivoted to CSS animations for faster delivery
3. **Process locked**: Single scout report delivery, immediate autonomous builds

## Files Created/Modified
- /var/www/previews/ai-safety-transparency/ - Ominous red/black aesthetic, mobile responsive
- /var/www/previews/video-infrastructure/ - Cinematic gold/purple aesthetic
- /var/www/previews/saas-infrastructure/ - Clean green/tech aesthetic  
- /var/www/previews/90-second-pitch/ - CSS animated slides
- /var/www/previews/living-timeline/ - Scrolling timeline animation
- Dashboard updated to 17 active pages
- Git commits: ac7c5861, b276999e

## Next Actions
- Continue building from scout reports autonomously
- Use existing Remotion template for video projects (don't configure from scratch)
- Verify file completeness before announcing completion
- Build first, message second
