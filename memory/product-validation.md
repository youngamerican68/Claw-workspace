# Product Validation Checklist

*Created: February 5, 2026*
*Context: Learned from SalesDeck AI build — technically successful, product-weak*

---

## Before Recommending a Build

### 1. Demand Validation
- [ ] **Specific buyer identified** — not "sales reps" but "enterprise AEs at companies with 6+ month sales cycles"
- [ ] **Evidence of payment** — are people paying for bad solutions? Complaining publicly? Failed startups in the space?
- [ ] **Current workaround is painful** — if email works fine, they won't switch to slides

### 2. Gap Analysis
- [ ] **Why does the gap exist?** — is it unsolved or unneeded?
- [ ] **Why haven't incumbents solved it?** — Gong could make decks. They don't. Why?
- [ ] **Adjacent tools haven't merged** — might mean customers aren't asking

### 3. Product vs Demo
- [ ] **What's the integration?** — paste-and-generate is a demo, not sticky
- [ ] **What's the lock-in?** — CRM sync, branding, team features
- [ ] **Would someone pay $X/month?** — if unclear, it's a feature not a product

### 4. Originality Check
- [ ] **Not just filling an obvious gap** — if it's obvious, why isn't it done?
- [ ] **Differentiated angle** — what's the unfair advantage?
- [ ] **Timing** — why now? What changed?

---

## Red Flags

- "Everyone could use this" → probably no one will pay
- "Podcast host mentioned they do this manually" → anecdote, not market
- "No one has built this exact thing" → might be intentional
- "Easy to build" → easy to copy, no moat
- Gap between two mature tool categories → they probably talked and decided not to merge

---

## Green Flags

- People paying for crappy alternatives
- Specific communities complaining repeatedly
- Recent platform shift enabling new approach
- Failed startups with post-mortems explaining timing was wrong (but timing is now right)
- Integration possible that creates lock-in

## The Scout Report Standard

When identifying opportunities, include:
1. **Evidence of demand** — not just "this could exist" but "people are asking for this"
2. **Why now** — what changed that makes this viable?
3. **Monetization path** — who pays, how much, why?
4. **Competitive moat** — what stops a clone tomorrow?
5. **Honest difficulty** — not just build time, but go-to-market effort

## Example: SalesDeck AI (What Went Wrong)

**What I said:** Podcast hosts manually doing Gong → LLM → Gamma workflow. Gap between call intelligence and deck generators. Build it.

**What I missed:**
- Most sales reps send emails, not decks
- Decks only matter for enterprise/consulting with buying committees
- Gong/Gamma haven't merged because customers don't ask
- The demo (paste transcript, get markdown) has no stickiness
- No integration, no branding, no CRM sync = no product

**Lesson:** Technical possibility ≠ market demand. The gap was intentional.
