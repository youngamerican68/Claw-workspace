# 2026-01-26 — First Day on DO

## What Happened

- Migrated from UTM VM to DigitalOcean droplet
- Encountered Telegram `getUpdates conflict` errors — caused by both instances polling with the same bot token
- Diagnosed by checking logs, confirmed by shutting down UTM
- Found UTM had a systemd user service (`clawdbot-gateway.service`) auto-starting — disabled with `systemctl --user disable clawdbot-gateway`
- Transferred `video-promo` skill from UTM to DO (Remotion-based video creation)
- Started browser setup for Twitter monitoring — installed Chromium, configured headless mode, working on Playwright browser

## Browser Setup Status (In Progress)

- Goal: Headless browser on DO for Twitter monitoring cron jobs
- Installed snap chromium (has AppArmor issues)
- Configured `browser.headless: true` and `browser.noSandbox: true`
- Installing Playwright's Chromium as alternative (better for servers)
- Next: Complete Playwright install, then Twitter login, then cron jobs

## Twitter Monitoring Plan

1. Get browser working on DO
2. Log into Twitter (one-time, save session)
3. Set up cron jobs to check Following + For You feeds
4. Paul mentioned this was working on UTM before

## Decisions

- DO droplet is the primary Clawdbot instance
- UTM VM disabled for now (can use separate bot token for local dev later)

## Notes

- Paul is in Bucks County, PA (Eastern time)
- Droplet: NYC3, IP `68.183.51.209`, ID `547365319`
- Git configured: user "Rook" <rook@clawd.bot>
