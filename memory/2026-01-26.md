# 2026-01-26 — First Day on DO

## What Happened

- Migrated from UTM VM to DigitalOcean droplet
- Encountered Telegram `getUpdates conflict` errors — caused by both instances polling with the same bot token
- Diagnosed by checking logs, confirmed by shutting down UTM
- Firewall was also disabled during troubleshooting
- Currently testing stability with UTM fully quit

## Decisions

- DO droplet is now the primary Clawdbot instance
- Consider creating a separate bot token for local dev to avoid future conflicts

## Notes

- Paul is in Bucks County, PA (Eastern time)
- Droplet is in NYC3 — low latency
