# 2026-02-05 - Session Notes

## Major Accomplishments

### SalesDeck AI - First Autonomous Build
- **URL**: https://salesdeck-ai.vercel.app/
- **Tech stack**: Next.js 14+, Tailwind, Framer Motion, shadcn/ui, OpenAI API, html2pdf.js
- **Origin**: Identified from scout convergence - Twitter buzz + Marketing Against The Grain podcast validation
- **Concept**: Paste sales call transcript → AI generates branded slide deck
- **Status**: Built by Paul using Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag
- **Prompt file**: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/prompts/salesdeck-ai-autonomous.md`

### Scout System Fully Operational
- **Twitter Scout**: Apify scrapes at 6am/6pm EST, analyzer-v2.js processes data, agent wakes 30min later
- **Podcast Scout**: Syncs from Paul's Mac Mon/Thu via rsync, 46 reports in system
- **Convergence**: Cross-references both sources for overlapping opportunities
- **Cron jobs**: 4 OpenClaw cron jobs configured (Twitter 2x daily, Podcast 2x weekly)

### Infrastructure
- **Brave Search API**: Configured at `tools.web.search.apiKey`, verified working (703ms response)
- **Projects server**: systemd service on port 8080, hosts landing pages + prompts
- **Crabwalk**: Running at http://68.183.51.209:3000/monitor

## Decisions Made
- **Scout→PRD→Build workflow**: Generate autonomous Claude Code prompts, Paul triggers builds
- **Same report format for both scouts**: Uses SCOUT_REPORT_FORMAT.md template
- **Frontend-design skill**: Required in all PRDs for distinctive UI (avoid "AI slop")
- **Vercel for deploys**: Standard target for web-based MVPs

## Projects Built Today
1. **Claw Starter Skills** - Landing page at `/projects/claw-starter-skills/`
2. **WingBot** - Landing page with Forty Licks gradient at `/projects/wingbot/`
3. **SalesDeck AI** - Full MVP deployed to Vercel

## What Didn't Work
- Git push failed (needs GitHub auth setup)
- VPS comparison site skipped (Paul said saturated on YouTube)

## Next Session
- Review SalesDeck AI deployment feedback
- Establish repeatable overnight autonomous build pattern
- Consider git-based PRD queue for hands-off overnight builds
