# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Knowledge

## Paul's Preferences

**Build Focus**
- Minimum 2 landing pages per scout report (enforced Feb 10, 2026)
- Wants execution, not just analysis
- Values "overnight employee" autonomy
- Prefers bullet points over tables/charts

**Communication**
- Direct, no fluff
- Silent execution for routine tasks
- Narrate only when valuable (problems, decisions, completions)

**What to Skip**
- Restaurant/salon cold pitch model (canned Feb 10)
- Overhyped "AI replaces X" narratives
- Saturated markets without differentiation

## Decisions Made

**Feb 10, 2026**
- Enhanced workflow: research → assessment → build (not just report)
- Memu-engine deferred (hold off for now)
- Exa MCP discussed but not prioritized
- Dashboard must have full inspiration details + delete functionality

**Feb 9, 2026**
- 3 landing pages built: Ops Reports, Agent Identity, Health Coach
- OpenClaw Ops Dashboard added as 4th project
- BUILD_QUEUE.md created for tracking
- HEARTBEAT.md updated to check queue

## Recurring Sources (High Signal)

**Twitter**
- Matthew Berman — OpenClaw ecosystem, dashboard demand
- Miles Deutscher — AI workflows, crypto macro
- Lenny Rachitsky — Product strategy, use case collection

**Podcasts**
- a16z Show — Infrastructure, AI tooling
- My First Million — Business opportunities
- Cal Newport — Deep work, productivity systems

## Patterns Observed

**Strong Signals**
- OpenClaw tooling (dashboards, memory, agents) = validated demand
- Verification/trust infrastructure = emerging theme
- Cost optimization = community priority (ClawRouter interest)

**Weak Signals**
- Generic AI advice threads (low engagement despite high followers)
- "AI replaces X" narratives (fatigue setting in)
- Consumer health apps (crowded, hard to monetize)

## Active Projects

1. **Ops Reports** — Terminal aesthetic, DevOps market
2. **Agent Identity** — Cyberpunk aesthetic, security focus
3. **Health Coach** — Organic aesthetic, wearables integration
4. **OpenClaw Ops** — Dark aesthetic, fleet monitoring
