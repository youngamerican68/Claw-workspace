## Action Items (Blocked on Paul)
- [ ] Install ffmpeg: `sudo apt install ffmpeg -y` — unlocks video rendering
- [ ] GitHub setup (one-time, 5 min at laptop):
  1. Create private repo on github.com (e.g., `rook-workspace`)
  2. Run `sudo apt install gh -y` on droplet
  3. Run `gh auth login` and follow prompts
- [ ] Connect Vercel to GitHub repo (one-click in Vercel dashboard)

## Action Items (Rook can do now)

- [ ] Prep FB ad variations (square, 6-sec story version)
- [ ] Write Reddit/FB post drafts for demand testing
- [x] Compare official Remotion Agent Skills vs our video-promo skill — DONE
  - Theirs: 31 rule files, technical reference
  - Ours: creative workflow, 6-scene formula
  - Verdict: complementary, not competing
  - Installed theirs + symlinked to ~/clawd/skills/

## Promising Ideas Surfaced

### 1. Remotion Video Agent (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Source:** Twitter scout, Remotion official tweet (13.8M views)
- **What:** AI agent that creates promo videos from PRs/features using Remotion
- **Validation:** Guillermo Rauch (Vercel CEO) endorsed, @rincidium spelled out the product spec
- **We have:** video-promo skill with Remotion template
- **Blocker:** Need ffmpeg installed on droplet (`sudo apt install ffmpeg`)
- **MVP flow:** Input PR → extract key points → generate Remotion composition → render MP4
- **Monetization:** Tutorial content, template packs ($29-49), done-for-you service ($99-199/video)

### 2. MissedCallCloser ⭐ (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Source:** Podium's "Jerry" — $100M+ ARR from AI agents for SMBs
- **What:** AI calls back missed leads within 60 seconds
- **Target:** Local businesses (plumbers, HVAC, dentists)
- **Pain:** 40% of calls go to voicemail, each missed call = $500+ lost
- **Tech stack:** Twilio + OpenAI voice + Calendly
- **Pricing:** $79/mo (100 mins), $199/mo unlimited
- **MVP:** 2 weeks
- **Distribution:** FB contractor groups, BNI groups
- **Validation:** Call 10 local plumbers, ask how many calls they missed last week

### 3. LegalSearchPro (LOWER PRIORITY)
- **Source:** Benchmark showing GPT-5.2 only 50% on legal search, Claude 0/24
- **What:** AI legal research that finds right cases without hallucinations
- **Pain:** Paralegals $25-50/hr, Westlaw/Lexis $200-500/mo
- **Pricing:** $99/mo basic, $249/mo teams
- **MVP:** 3 weeks
- **Concerns:** Regulated space, liability, competing with entrenched players

## Security Audit
- Reviewed Daniel Miessler's Clawdbot security thread (108K views)
- Our setup: Gateway bound to localhost ✅, DM policy using pairing ✅
- Gaps: No Docker isolation, no explicit exec blocklist, ffmpeg not installed
- Not urgent for single-user setup

## Scout Infrastructure
- Added smol.ai news scout (daily 9am Eastern)
- Twitter scout continues (every 6 hours)
- **Improvement:** Dig into articles, summarize content, not just surface tweets

## Workflow Discussion
- Discussed how I code (read/write/exec on DO droplet, no visual IDE)
- Discussed preview workflow (I screenshot → send to Telegram, or deploy to Vercel)
- Need to set up GitHub remote for PR workflow
- Need `gh` CLI installed and authed

## Key Article: "You're Using AI Wrong" (Chris Do)
- AI is great for ideation, terrible for precise execution
- Ideal workflow: Intent (human) → Labor (AI) → Judgment (human)
- Don't "one-shot" — use AI as collaborator, apply human taste for finish
