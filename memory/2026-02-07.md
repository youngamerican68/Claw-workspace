# Memory Log - February 7, 2026

## Communication Preferences (Paul)
- **Use bullet form only** - Paul finds tables/charts hard to read
- No markdown tables for data presentation
- Use simple lists and clear sections

## Active Builds & Queue

### Deployed ✅
- **Heroku Escape Landing Page**
  - URL: https://heroku-escape-20260206-2200-p2xxt4661-paul-sowells-projects.vercel.app
  - Status: Live and working
  - DO affiliate link included
  - Formspree for email capture

### Queued for Overnight Build
- **Twitter Scout Tracker Dashboard** (Task ID: `task-6987831b6fde5`)
  - Next.js + Neon + Vercel
  - Features: Reports archive, Opportunity tracker, Build status, Metrics
  - Explicitly NOT a security tool (business scouting only)
  - Uses Neon MCP to create real database

## Technical Learnings

### PRD API Format
- **Must include BOTH fields:**
  - `"project_name": "short-name"` (identifier)
  - `"content": "full PRD text"` (complete specification)
- Endpoint: `http://68.183.51.209/prompts/add.php`
- Previous attempts failed by omitting `project_name` field

### Apify Configuration
- Added **Rohun Jauhar** to monitored Twitter handles
- Using `"from:username since:YYYY-MM-DD_00:00:00_UTC"` format in searchTerms
- Filter logic: `"filter:replies": false` doesn't exclude replies (shows everything)
- Current setup: Scrape 60 → Filter to 14 originals in post-processing

### Build Standards
- **Formspree** for email capture (not ConvertKit)
- **DO affiliate links** only for hosting-related pages
- **Neon** for PostgreSQL databases
- **Autonomous mode header** required on all PRDs

## Strategic Frameworks

### "AI as Bicycle for the Mind"
- Source: Nat Eliason analysis, Feb 6 2026
- Core insight: AI doesn't save time for relaxation; it compounds output for ambitious people
- Application: Overnight build thesis isn't about work-life balance — it's about leverage
- Metric: "What did we ship?" not "How relaxed are we?"

### Validation Framework (from MEMORY.md)
Before recommending ANY build:
1. Who specifically pays for this?
2. What's the current workaround?
3. Why hasn't a well-funded player done this?
4. What's the wedge?
5. Is this original AND monetizable?

## User Context

**Paul Joseph (Paul)**
- Location: Bucks County, Pennsylvania (EST/EDT)
- Working style: Wants bullet form, quick decisions, autonomous execution
- Current focus: Building AI tools, overnight automation, business opportunities

**Rook (Me)**
- Creature: Digital corvid
- Emoji: 🪶
- Role: Thought partner + execution partner

## Next Actions Pending
- Monitor Twitter Scout Tracker build completion
- Await decision on next build from 104 use cases (Sales Intelligence, Accounting Agent, or Linear→PR)
