This study examines how the adoption of robotic systems (RSA) promotes business model innovation (BMI) in manufacturing firms, with a particular focus on the dual and serial mediation roles of innovation capabilities and organizational agility. Grounded in the dynamic capabilities theory and the technology acceptance model, this research also examines whether trust in human–robot interaction moderates the influence of RSA on innovation capabilities and BMI. Due to the multilevel nature of the constructs, the study adopts a cross-level design, collecting data from managers and employees of Chinese manufacturing firms. Using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), we find that RSA is positively associated with BMI, innovation capabilities and organizational agility. Furthermore, both innovation capabilities and organizational agility mediate the relationship between RSA and BMI, with evidence supporting a serial mediation pathway. Additionally, human–robot interaction trust strengthens the impact of RSA on both innovation capabilities and BMI. These findings underscore the strategic importance of adopting robotic systems and cultivating trust in human–robot collaboration to enhance innovation potential and drive business model transformation in manufacturing firms.

Innovation outcomes remain highly unpredictable, with global estimates showing that a significant proportion of new products fail to reach commercial viability. As markets become more dynamic and data-abundant, Business Intelligence (BI) has emerged as a critical capability for identifying adoption patterns and minimizing innovation failure risk. This paper provides a systematic review of BI frameworks that contribute to product adoption prediction across industries. Drawing on interdisciplinary research in information systems, marketing analytics, innovation management, and machine learning, the review synthesizes theoretical foundations, analytical techniques, and enterprise BI architectures that enhance foresight and strategic decision-making. The findings reveal that BI-enabled prediction models significantly improve early detection of adoption barriers, strengthen market-sensing capability, and enhance innovation performance through continuous learning loops. The paper concludes by highlighting current methodological gaps, proposing an integrated conceptual model, and offering directions for future research.

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is driving transformation in the built environment. While technical aspects have been widely explored, less is known about how cloud-based BIM (CBIM) supports business strategy and growth. This gap poses a challenge for organisations aiming to integrate digital innovation with competitive advantage. This study develops a CBIM business model framework, identifying strategic drivers for business expansion. Unlike prior BMC adaptations, the proposed framework integrates both microeconomic dimensions (e.g., pricing logic, competition, diversification) and macroeconomic dimensions (e.g., governance, sustainability, reskilling), explicitly linking firm-level strategies with broader institutional and digital infrastructure factors. A qualitative multi-case study was conducted, involving nine semi-structured interviews with CBIM experts across Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, and the UK. Participants represented both BIM consumers (e.g., construction companies and consultants) and BIM producers (e.g., software vendors and platform providers). Purposeful sampling ensured sectoral and role diversity. Data was coded and analysed thematically using Atlas. ti qualitative analysis software. The study identifies nine strategic drivers for CBIM business growth, including a redefined value proposition, customer awareness, cloud infrastructure, product and service pricing logic, distribution channels, human resource capabilities, strategic use of competition, diversification, governance and sustainability. The study proposes a CBIM-adapted Business Model Canvas framework, providing actionable insights for startups and SMEs, including guidance on integrating cloud pricing models and aligning internal capabilities with digital strategy such as guidance on integrating cloud pricing models and aligning internal capabilities with digital strategy, while also highlighting strategies that incumbents can adopt to maintain competitiveness in a rapidly digitising construction ecosystem.

### How Green Finance and Innovation Shape Environmental Competitiveness: A Business Strategy Perspective on Sustainability and Corporate Performance

**Business Strategy and the Environment** | Rakesh Kumar, Himanshu Gupta | 2026-02-01
**Link:** https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.70593


 In response to escalating environmental imperatives, this study examines how green finance and green innovation jointly enhance corporate performance, with corporate sustainability functioning as a strategic mediator. Although existing research often addresses these constructs in isolation, limited attention has been given to their integrated influence in emerging economies and resource‐constrained sectors. Drawing on the Resource‐Based View and Ecological Modernization Theory, the study develops and empirically tests a sustainability‐oriented strategy framework. A two‐phase methodology was employed: First, a comprehensive literature review identified key constructs and linkages; second, survey data from Indian manufacturing and service organizations were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings confirm that green finance and green innovation significantly strengthen corporate sustainability, which mediates their impact on performance. The study contributes to sustainability strategy literature and provides actionable insights for managers and policymakers seeking transformative pathways toward sustainable competitiveness.

 Agri-tech enterprises require innovative business models and market entry strategies to achieve financial sustainability amid rapid technological adoption. This study investigates how business model innovations (BMIs) and market entry approaches influence financial performance metrics in agri-based firms, addressing a critical gap in empirical financial analysis of agritech ecosystems.
 
 
 
 Systematic bibliometric analysis of 620 Scopus-indexed articles using VOSviewer network mapping identified 52 core studies (PRISMA-compliant). Content analysis extracted dominant BMIs and market strategies. Regression modeling assessed financial outcomes across four entry strategies: direct export, franchising, joint ventures, and digital platforms, using ROI, net profit margin, and payback period as dependent variables.
 
 
 
 
 Ten dominant BMIs emerged: contract farming, precision agriculture, digital marketplaces, AI decision systems, blockchain traceability, and product-as-a-service models. Digital platform entry yielded highest ROI (β = 0.42,
 p
 < 0.01) and profitability. Market size and capital investment significantly predicted success (
 R
 2
 = 0.67,
 F
 = 45.3,
 p
 < 0.001). Bibliometric clusters confirmed precision agriculture and digital platforms as research hotspots.
 
 
 
 
 Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas and Triple-Layered BMC provide optimal frameworks for agri-fintech scaling. Digital market entry maximizes returns while enhancing sustainability. Policymakers should prioritize digital infrastructure and agri-startup financing to accelerate adoption. Findings guide investors toward high-ROI agritech opportunities balancing innovation with financial viability.
