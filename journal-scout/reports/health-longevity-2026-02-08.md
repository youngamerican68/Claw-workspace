Malnutrition is a common clinical problem causing poor outcomes, including longer hospital stays, complications, functional decline, and mortality. Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are a key component of medical nutrition therapy for patients who cannot meet their nutritional needs through diet alone. Despite their proven effectiveness, ONS use in practice remains inconsistent due to the lack of comprehensive, practice-based, and internationally validated guidelines. In 2023, the Turkish Clinical Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition Society (KEPAN) developed a national consensus report to address this gap. To enhance international validity and applicability, this study aimed to validate and refine those recommendations through a global Delphi process involving multidisciplinary experts.

**Nature reviews. Microbiology** | Mej&#xed;a-Caballero, Marco | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40702328/

Lactobacilli encompass more than 300 species, spanning 25 genera, found in the microbiomes of humans, animals and plants with relevance in agriculture, foods and medicine. Lactobacilli comprise all bacteria previously assigned to the Lactobacillus genus and, similar to other lactic acid bacteria, are characterized by their saccharolytic, fermentation-energy metabolism and diverse enzymatic pathways that support redox balance and maintain intracellular pH. Some lactobacilli are pervasive in dairy, meat and plant foods, where they either contribute to spoilage and food waste or are desired and necessary for the production of fermented foods and animal feed. Strains of lactobacilli are the most applied probiotics tested in clinical studies. The study of host-associated intestinal and vaginal microbiomes has demonstrated that lactobacilli drive epithelial and immune cell responses, resulting in mainly beneficial effects on host health. This Review explores both established and emerging concepts related to this group of microorganisms. It highlights central tenants of their genetic diversity, metabolism, stress tolerance and distribution across host-associated microbiomes, as well as their importance in fermented foods and in health modulation as probiotics. With this accumulated knowledge, there remain substantial opportunities for expanded application of lactobacilli across different domains relevant to food production and health.

The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining health by supporting digestion, immunity, and overall well-being. Disruptions to the gut microbiome can result in dysbiosis, which is correlated with disease states. Recent advances in engineering the gut microbiome, functional ingredients designed through prebiotics, probiotics, and&#xa0;synbiotics have progressed together with synthetic microbial communities (SynComs), which&#xa0;influence the modulation of microbiome composition and functional role, offering a promising strategy to restore balance and enhance health. This field is rapidly advancing with broad applications focused on improving animal and human health. This review explores the significance and current applications of the engineering microbiome and its impact on gut health, as well as the challenges and sustainable future.

### Microbiome-modulated immunotherapy in oncology: Current applications and future prospects.

**Seminars in cancer biology** | Liu, Miao, Yang | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41520913/

Cancer immunotherapy has transformed oncology, yet therapeutic efficacy remains heterogeneous and frequently limited by primary or acquired resistance. Increasing evidence demonstrates that both intra- and extratumoral microbiota critically modulate antitumor immunity, influencing clinical responses of immunotherapy and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Microbial communities regulate the tumor immune microenvironment through multiple mechanisms, including microbe-associated molecular patterns, microbial metabolites, and outer membrane vesicles, acting on tumor or immune cells. These insights have fostered the development of microbiome-based applications in oncology, ranging from predictive biomarkers to therapeutic interventions such as engineered bacteria, fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, outer membrane vesicles, bacteriophages, and dietary modulation. Early-phase clinical studies indicate that microbiota-targeted strategies can enhance immunotherapy efficacy or mitigate irAEs, although strain specificity, interindividual variability, and safety remain significant challenges. Future progress will require mechanistic elucidation, integration of multi-omics analyses, standardization of methodologies, and personalized intervention frameworks to translate microbiome modulation into clinically actionable, precision immunotherapy.

### The gut microbiota in post-stroke depression: A systematic review of microbial mechanisms and therapeutic targeting of neuroinflammation.

**Microbiological research** | Zhang, Zhang, Cao et al. | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41260033/

Post-stroke depression (PSD), a frequent and debilitating complication after stroke, severely hinders rehabilitation. Emerging evidence underscores the role of neuroinflammation and the gut microbiota in PSD pathogenesis. This review systematically elaborates the mechanisms by which gut dysbiosis contributes to PSD-related neuroinflammation via immune cell regulation (e.g., Treg/Th17 balance), microbial metabolites (e.g., SCFAs, tryptophan derivatives), and neural pathways (vagus nerve, HPA axis). A key focus is the comparative analysis of the gut microbiota in PSD against major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), revealing a unique, stroke-induced microbial signature characterized by a loss of protective symbionts and a bloom of pro-inflammatory taxa. We further discuss the translational potential of microbiota-targeted interventions (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics) for PSD. By integrating clinical microbial ecology with mechanistic insights, this review synthesizes evidence suggesting that the gut microbiome may represent a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target for PSD, offering a distinct perspective from previous literature.

### Feeding preweaning Holstein calves a synbiotic supplement increases their energy-corrected milk yield as lactating cows.

**Journal of dairy science** | Muhffel, Aly, Lucey et al. | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41651372/

Prebiotics and probiotics are feed additives that can benefit the host by modulating the gut microbiome, which is crucial in digestion, immunity, and overall animal health. This study aims to evaluate the effects of supplementing prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics to preweaning Holstein calves on their future milk yield. This study is a retrospective analysis of milk yield records from dairy cows that were randomized at birth to 1 of 4 twice-daily treatments administered during the preweaning period: (1) control, no additive (CON), (2) prebiotic (PRE; 7 mL of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast culture), (3) probiotic (PRO; Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus plantarum, delivering &#x223c;1 billion and 250 million cfu per head per day, respectively), or (4) synbiotic (SYN; combination of both PRE and PRO at the same dosages as the PRE and PRO treatments). The study was conducted on a dairy farm in Fresno County, California, between 2019 and 2023, involving 1,296 Holstein cows over their first 3 lactations for a total of 2,735 lactations. Monthly test day records for milk yield, fat, and protein were used to calculate ECM, standardized to 4% fat and 3.3% protein, totaling 26,464 monthly test day milk records. A 2-piece splines mixed-effect regression model evaluated the effect of treatments on ECM yield. For the first lactation, ECM yield was estimated at 28.66 kg on the first DIM, peaked at 42.1 kg, and declined to 21.34 kg by 305 DIM. For parity &#x2265;2, ECM yield was 41.06 kg at 1 DIM, peaked at 54.2 kg, and 33.74 kg at 305 DIM. The SYN treatment increased ECM yield by 1.00 kg/d compared with CON. This increase was primarily due to an increase in milk fat yield, with 0.048 kg/d more fat produced compared with the control group. No differences in ECM yield between PRE, PRO, or CON were observed. These findings suggest that supplementing SYN during the preweaning period increased milk, milk fat, and ECM yield across lactations 1, 2, and 3.

### Pathobionts in the microbiome: Drivers of disease and targets for treatment.

**Microbial pathogenesis** | Bharathi, Soundara Rajan, Prakash et al. | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41461285/

Pathobionts are commensal inhabitants of the human microbiome that can transition to a pathogenic state under specific genetic or environmental conditions. They have recently gained attention for their impact on various clinical conditions. This review discusses the key factors behind pathobiont emergence, including microbial dysbiosis, antibiotic use, dietary influences, immune dysfunction and host genetics. It provides a comprehensive overview of pathobionts associated with the gut, oral cavity, and vaginal microbiomes highlighting their roles in disease pathogenesis. A significant focus is also placed on the involvement of pathobiont in immune-related disorders. Furthermore, current and advanced therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of pathobionts, such as faecal microbiota transplantation, phage therapy, probiotics and prebiotics, along with their advantages and limitations, were highlighted. Thus, the integrated perspective combining microbial ecology, host immunity, and therapeutic strategies outlines the need for targeted, microbiome-based interventions to address the complex behaviour of pathobionts.

### Valorization of dairy by-products for milk-based infant formulas: A nutritional perspective review.

**Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)** | A&#x11f;ag&#xfc;nd&#xfc;z, &#x15e;ahin, &#xc7;elik et al. | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41508506/

The valorization of dairy by-products presents a sustainable approach to enhancing the nutritional quality of infant formulas while addressing environmental concerns. This review explores the potential of milk-derived components, including whey proteins, casein, lactose, galactooligosaccharides (GOS), and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), in infant nutrition. These by-products, often sourced from dairy waste, exhibit functional and bioactive properties that mimic human breast milk, supporting infant growth, immune function, and gut health. MFGM, rich in phospholipids and bioactive peptides, promotes neurological development and reduces infection risks, while lactose and GOS foster beneficial gut microbiota. Besides, the review highlights biotechnological and physicochemical methods for valorizing dairy waste, such as enzymatic hydrolysis and membrane filtration, to recover high-value ingredients. Whey proteins, hydrolyzed for easier digestion, and casein derivatives, like A2 &#x3b2;-casein, offer hypoallergenic and growth-supporting benefits. GOS, synthesized from lactose, serves as a prebiotic, though its efficacy differs from human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Probiotics, derived from dairy or breast milk, further enhance gut microbiota and immune responses in formula-fed infants. Despite advancements, challenges remain in replicating breast milk's complexity, particularly in MFGM structure and HMO diversity. Regulatory standards and safety evaluations are critical for commercial application. Future research should focus on optimizing these components to bridge nutritional gaps and ensure safety, offering a promising pathway for sustainable and health-focused infant nutrition.

### Effects of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics on P53 and KI-67 in colorectal cancer: a scoping review.

**Letters in applied microbiology** | Guimar&#xe3;es, Trindade, das Dores Rocha et al. | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41524176/

Changes in the gut microbiota (GM) are closely linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) development, influencing tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. Prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics have been proposed as modulators of GM and potential regulators of tumor progression through key molecular markers, such as p53 and Ki-67. In this sense, a scoping review was performed following PRISMA-ScR guidelines to map available evidence on the impact of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on p53 and Ki-67 expression in CRC. Search was conducted in PubMed, SciELo, BVS/Lilacs, Embase, and Web of Science databases without date or language restrictions. Nineteen studies were included (18 preclinical and one randomized clinical trial). Ten studies assessed p53, seven evaluates Ki-67, and two examined both markers. Most preclinical studies suggested that biotic supplementation modulates apoptosis and proliferation-related pathways, often through p53 activation or Ki-67 suppression, although directionality varied across strains and models. Biotic interventions appear to influence tumor proliferation markers in CRC with strain- and model-dependent manner. Nevertheless, the evidence remains limited by heterogeneity of the study design, dosage, exposure time, and biomarker assessment. Well-designed and strain-resolved clinical trials are required to clarify whether these findings have translational and therapeutic relevance in CRC management.

**Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis &amp; frontotemporal degeneration** | Chaouch, Crook, Douglas et al. | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40779613/

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease thought to be precipitated by genetic, environment and lifestyle factors. In the UK, whole genome sequencing has become available to all people living with ALS, regardless of their family history or age of onset of disease. However, there is currently no formal guidance on how to deliver genetic counseling and testing in busy mainstream clinics. This article offers practical suggestions to clinicians who may wish or need to discuss genomic testing. As more clinical trials and targeted gene therapies develop, it is likely that conversations will evolve, reflecting the dynamic nature of this important and complex field.

### Interplay of accelerated biological aging, lifestyle factors, and genetic susceptibility in cognitive function: a community study.

**The journals of gerontology. Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences** | Ma, Chen, Zhao et al. | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41389215/

Cognitive impairment is a significant health concern in aging populations, but the interplay between biological aging, lifestyle factors, and genetic susceptibility remains unclear. This study examined whether accelerated biological aging is associated with cognitive impairment, whether lifestyle modifies this association, and how genetic background influences these relationships in Chinese older adults. In this cross-sectional study (2022-2023), 7033 participants from southwestern China were included. Accelerated biological aging was calculated as the residual difference between biological age (based on 10 biomarkers) and chronological age. Lifestyle was assessed via a composite index (smoking, alcohol, physical activity, diet, sleep). Cognitive function was measured using the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination (C-MMSE), and genetic risk was evaluated through polygenic scores and APOE &#x3b5;4 status. Linear and logistic regression models assessed associations between accelerated aging and cognition. Accelerated biological aging was associated with lower MMSE scores (&#x200a;&#x3b2; = -0.243, 95% CI: -0.354, -0.133) and higher cognitive impairment prevalence (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.098, 95% CI: 1.040, 1.158). An unhealthy lifestyle exacerbated cognitive impairment in biologically older individuals (RERI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.25). Those with both accelerated aging and unhealthy lifestyle had the lowest MMSE scores (&#x200a;&#x3b2; = -1.424, 95% CI: -1.846, -1.003) and highest odds of cognitive impairment (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.467, 95% CI: 1.194, 1.803). These effects were consistent across all genetic background subgroups. Accelerated aging was associated with lower cognitive function, especially in individuals with unhealthy lifestyles, regardless of genetic susceptibility. This highlights lifestyle modification as a potential intervention target for aging-related cognitive impairment.
