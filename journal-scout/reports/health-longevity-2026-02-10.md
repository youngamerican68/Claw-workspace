This manuscript presents the study protocol of the PRICA-POWFRAIL randomized controlled trial. Frailty and pre-frailty are major predictors of functional decline and dependency in older adults, yet the implementation of personalized, scalable, and clinically interventions in primary care remains limited. This protocol describes the methodological design and planned evaluation of a lifestyle education programme and an individualized exercise-prescription algorithm aimed at improving intrinsic capacity and preventing dependency.
