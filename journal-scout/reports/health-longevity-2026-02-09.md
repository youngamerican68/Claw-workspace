Changes in the gut microbiota (GM) are closely linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) development, influencing tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. Prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics have been proposed as modulators of GM and potential regulators of tumor progression through key molecular markers, such as p53 and Ki-67. In this sense, a scoping review was performed following PRISMA-ScR guidelines to map available evidence on the impact of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on p53 and Ki-67 expression in CRC. Search was conducted in PubMed, SciELo, BVS/Lilacs, Embase, and Web of Science databases without date or language restrictions. Nineteen studies were included (18 preclinical and one randomized clinical trial). Ten studies assessed p53, seven evaluates Ki-67, and two examined both markers. Most preclinical studies suggested that biotic supplementation modulates apoptosis and proliferation-related pathways, often through p53 activation or Ki-67 suppression, although directionality varied across strains and models. Biotic interventions appear to influence tumor proliferation markers in CRC with strain- and model-dependent manner. Nevertheless, the evidence remains limited by heterogeneity of the study design, dosage, exposure time, and biomarker assessment. Well-designed and strain-resolved clinical trials are required to clarify whether these findings have translational and therapeutic relevance in CRC management.

Probiotics enhance food nutrition and promote human health owing to their bioactive metabolites and regulatory effects on the gut microbiota. The oligosaccharide (OGS) shows excellent prebiotic characteristics of bioavailability, digestibility, and absorption efficiency, but probiotic-derived OGS has been rarely reported. Herein, Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) MA2 OGS was extracted, purified, and characterized, the monosaccharides of which were mainly composed of galactose, glucose, and mannose. MA2 OGS could inhibit &#x3b2;-amyloid 40 (A&#x3b2;40) aggregation and fibrillogenesis, mitigate aggregation-induced cytotoxicity, and disassemble the mature fibrils in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, when the MA2 OGS composite was used with 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl-modified phenylalanine (Fmoc-F), the gelatinization properties of Fmoc-F@OGS hydrogels were improved, including water retention, rheological characteristics, moisture distribution, and thermal degradability. This study offers theoretical and practical value for developing probiotic-based functional foods with improved nutrient delivery and sustained release.

Prebiotics and probiotics are feed additives that can benefit the host by modulating the gut microbiome, which is crucial in digestion, immunity, and overall animal health. This study aims to evaluate the effects of supplementing prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics to preweaning Holstein calves on their future milk yield. This study is a retrospective analysis of milk yield records from dairy cows that were randomized at birth to 1 of 4 twice-daily treatments administered during the preweaning period: (1) control, no additive (CON), (2) prebiotic (PRE; 7 mL of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast culture), (3) probiotic (PRO; Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus plantarum, delivering &#x223c;1 billion and 250 million cfu per head per day, respectively), or (4) synbiotic (SYN; combination of both PRE and PRO at the same dosages as the PRE and PRO treatments). The study was conducted on a dairy farm in Fresno County, California, between 2019 and 2023, involving 1,296 Holstein cows over their first 3 lactations for a total of 2,735 lactations. Monthly test day records for milk yield, fat, and protein were used to calculate ECM, standardized to 4% fat and 3.3% protein, totaling 26,464 monthly test day milk records. A 2-piece splines mixed-effect regression model evaluated the effect of treatments on ECM yield. For the first lactation, ECM yield was estimated at 28.66 kg on the first DIM, peaked at 42.1 kg, and declined to 21.34 kg by 305 DIM. For parity &#x2265;2, ECM yield was 41.06 kg at 1 DIM, peaked at 54.2 kg, and 33.74 kg at 305 DIM. The SYN treatment increased ECM yield by 1.00 kg/d compared with CON. This increase was primarily due to an increase in milk fat yield, with 0.048 kg/d more fat produced compared with the control group. No differences in ECM yield between PRE, PRO, or CON were observed. These findings suggest that supplementing SYN during the preweaning period increased milk, milk fat, and ECM yield across lactations 1, 2, and 3.

### Interplay of accelerated biological aging, lifestyle factors, and genetic susceptibility in cognitive function: a community study.

**The journals of gerontology. Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences** | Ma, Chen, Zhao et al. | 2026 Feb

Cognitive impairment is a significant health concern in aging populations, but the interplay between biological aging, lifestyle factors, and genetic susceptibility remains unclear. This study examined whether accelerated biological aging is associated with cognitive impairment, whether lifestyle modifies this association, and how genetic background influences these relationships in Chinese older adults. In this cross-sectional study (2022-2023), 7033 participants from southwestern China were included. Accelerated biological aging was calculated as the residual difference between biological age (based on 10 biomarkers) and chronological age. Lifestyle was assessed via a composite index (smoking, alcohol, physical activity, diet, sleep). Cognitive function was measured using the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination (C-MMSE), and genetic risk was evaluated through polygenic scores and APOE &#x3b5;4 status. Linear and logistic regression models assessed associations between accelerated aging and cognition. Accelerated biological aging was associated with lower MMSE scores (&#x200a;&#x3b2; = -0.243, 95% CI: -0.354, -0.133) and higher cognitive impairment prevalence (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.098, 95% CI: 1.040, 1.158). An unhealthy lifestyle exacerbated cognitive impairment in biologically older individuals (RERI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.25). Those with both accelerated aging and unhealthy lifestyle had the lowest MMSE scores (&#x200a;&#x3b2; = -1.424, 95% CI: -1.846, -1.003) and highest odds of cognitive impairment (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.467, 95% CI: 1.194, 1.803). These effects were consistent across all genetic background subgroups. Accelerated aging was associated with lower cognitive function, especially in individuals with unhealthy lifestyles, regardless of genetic susceptibility. This highlights lifestyle modification as a potential intervention target for aging-related cognitive impairment.

### Brain aging in neurodevelopmental disorders: a narrative review of oxidative, inflammatory, and mitochondrial mechanisms.

**Neurodegenerative disease management** | de Aguiar da Costa, de Rezende, Bolan et al. | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41636576/

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disability, and Down syndrome, are increasingly examined through the lens of aging. Emerging evidence indicates that individuals with NDDs may exhibit accelerated or atypical brain aging, characterized by cognitive decline and increased vulnerability to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. This narrative review synthesizes current findings on biological mechanisms implicated in altered aging trajectories, with emphasis on oxidative stress, chronic neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular senescence. These processes, detectable from early development, mirror pathways involved in neurodegeneration, suggesting shared molecular cascades that increase susceptibility to early aging. Biomarker studies report telomere shortening, elevated plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light chain levels, and deviations in neuroimaging-derived brain age, supporting the hypothesis of altered biological aging in NDDs. However, the limited number of longitudinal lifespan studies, along with marked heterogeneity in etiology, clinical profiles, and comorbidities, constrains causal inference. Psychosocial and environmental factors, including chronic stress, social exclusion, medical comorbidities, and lifestyle influences, further shape aging outcomes. Integrating biological, behavioral, and environmental markers is essential to advance monitoring and inform early interventions aimed at promoting healthier cognitive and functional aging in neurodivergent populations.

### NAD&#x207a; supplementation for anti-aging and wellness: a PRISMA-guided systematic review of preclinical and clinical evidence.

**Ageing research reviews** | Gallagher, Emmanuel | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41655607/

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&#x207a;) declines with age, motivating "NAD&#x207a;-boosting" strategies ranging from lifestyle interventions to supplementation with NAD&#x207a; precursors (e.g., nicotinamide riboside [NR], nicotinamide mononucleotide [NMN]) and, in some wellness settings, parenteral NAD&#x207a; administration. We conducted a PRISMA-guided systematic review of peer-reviewed human and rodent intervention studies (January 2010-October 2025) evaluating NAD-related compounds administered orally or parenterally. We identified 113 eligible studies: 33 human intervention studies (28 randomized; 5 nonrandomized) and 80 rodent studies. In rodent models, NAD&#x207a; augmentation was frequently associated with improvements in metabolic, mitochondrial, inflammatory, and functional outcomes, although effects varied across models and endpoints. In humans, oral NR and NMN consistently demonstrated biochemical target engagement (circulating (plasma/whole blood) or cellular (e.g., PBMC) NAD-related metabolites) and were generally well tolerated over weeks to months; however, effects on functional, metabolic, vascular, and other healthspan-relevant outcomes were heterogeneous and often null or endpoint-specific. No eligible outcomes trials evaluated intravenous or intramuscular NAD&#x207a; itself for anti-aging or wellness indications. One nonrandomized intravenous NMN study met inclusion criteria and primarily contributed short-term safety and biomarker information. An intravenous NAD&#x207a; pharmacokinetic pilot lacking eligible clinical outcomes was identified as contextual evidence only. Overall, NAD&#x207a; augmentation shows clear biological activity, but clinical effectiveness for anti-aging or wellness outcomes remains inconclusive. Larger, well-designed randomized trials with longer follow-up and prespecified clinically meaningful endpoints are needed, particularly for parenteral approaches.

### Genotoxicity of cancer therapies and the risk of secondary malignancies: toward personalized prevention.

**Clinical &amp; translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico** | Molehin, Afolabi | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41637000/

The evolution of cancer therapies has dramatically improved patient survival but has also revealed a critical challenge: the long-term genotoxic effects that can lead to secondary primary malignancies (SPMs). This review synthesizes current knowledge on how diverse treatment modalities, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted agents, and immunotherapies, induce DNA damage in normal tissues. It details the distinct mechanisms of genotoxicity, from the direct DNA lesions caused by cytotoxic drugs and ionizing radiation to the indirect damage mediated by oxidative stress and inflammation from newer therapies. The article identifies a range of multifactorial risk factors for SPMs, encompassing patient-specific variables such as age, genetic predisposition, and lifestyle, as well as therapy-related factors such as dose, duration, and combination regimens. It then evaluates the progression of monitoring methods, from traditional cytogenetic assays to advanced molecular and multi-omics biomarkers, highlighting their potential to predict individual susceptibility and inform risk stratification. By exploring pharmacogenomics and its role in genotype-guided dosing, the review proposes a framework for personalized prevention strategies. These strategies include risk-adapted regimens, prophylactic interventions, and the use of AI-driven predictive models. Ultimately, this comprehensive analysis underscores the urgent need to advance personalized prevention in oncology to balance therapeutic efficacy with long-term genomic safety for cancer survivors.

### From Ageing Clocks to Organ Networks: Biological Age-Driven Organ Asynchrony and Inter-organ Interactions Shaping Mortality Risk.

**Ageing research reviews** | Li, Liu, Dai et al. | 2026 Feb
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41655608/

Ageing is a multidimensional and heterogeneous process that progresses asynchronously across organ systems. Advances in multi-omics technologies have led to the development of diverse ageing clocks, including epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomic, and imaging-based models, which extend beyond estimating crude biological age to more precisely capture organ-specific ageing trajectories and predict age-related diseases and mortality risk. Population-scale studies demonstrate substantial within-individual variation in organ-ageing rates, showing that accelerated ageing in specific organs and increased numbers of aged organs markedly contribute to systemic dysregulation and elevated mortality risk. Multi-organ-ageing clocks further highlight the role of organ crosstalk networks, such as cardiovascular-pulmonary-cerebral interactions, in shaping healthspan and survival. Building on these insights, we propose a conceptual artificial intelligence (AI)-driven multi-omics health platform that integrates clinical data, imaging, wearable sensors, and organ-specific ageing clocks to enable continuous monitoring of biological age and early risk detection. This platform supports stratified management, whereby individuals with mild ageing may benefit from lifestyle-based interventions, while those with accelerated or multi-organ ageing receive personalised pharmacological and clinical strategies. Together, multi-omics ageing clocks and AI-enabled analytics provide a transformative framework for understanding human ageing, shifting from single-organ assessment to network-level evaluation and precision anti-ageing interventions. These advances lay the groundwork for a scalable national health ecosystem aimed at extending healthy lifespan and reducing population-wide mortality risk.
