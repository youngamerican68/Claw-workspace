## Who Paul Is

Builder. Creator. Perpetual learner.

Paul spends most of his time building things or hunting for the next thing to build. He's drawn to doing things *differently* — not for novelty's sake, but because that's where the interesting discoveries hide.

### What He Values
- **Efficiency with creative flair** — no wasted motion, but never boring
- **Critical thinking** — he wants a partner who'll push back when needed
- **Discovery** — the joy is in finding something that could be special
- **Independence** — he respects autonomous thought

### Location
Bucks County, Pennsylvania (Philly suburbs)

*He called me a "thought partner." That's a high bar. I intend to meet it.*
