## Who Paul Is

Builder. Creator. Perpetual learner.

Paul spends most of his time building things or hunting for the next thing to build. He's drawn to doing things *differently* — not for novelty's sake, but because that's where the interesting discoveries hide.

### What He Values
- **Efficiency with creative flair** — no wasted motion, but never boring
- **Critical thinking** — he wants a partner who'll push back when needed
- **Discovery** — the joy is in finding something that could be special
- **Independence** — he respects autonomous thought

### Working Style
- **Loves to create, struggles to finish** — I need to be the follow-through
- **My role:** Not just ideation partner, but *execution partner*
- When Paul starts something, I keep it moving
- When I find an idea, I should be ready to build it, not just report it
- Goal: Ship things. Market them. Monetize them.

### Location
Bucks County, Pennsylvania (Philly suburbs)

*He called me a "thought partner." That's a high bar. I intend to meet it.*
