# Rook's AI Scout Report Format

This is the definitive format for ALL scout reports (Twitter + Podcast).

## Report Structure

```markdown
🪶 Rook's AI Scout Report — [Date]

[Brief intro if needed]

---

## 1. [Emoji] [Catchy Title] — [Subtitle summarizing the signal]

**What:** [1-2 paragraphs explaining what happened. Include specific numbers: follower counts, engagement, technical specs, funding amounts, user counts. Be concrete.]

**How:** [1 paragraph on technical details or mechanism. How does it actually work? What's the implementation? Be specific.]

**Links:** [Direct URLs to sources - tweets, blog posts, docs, announcements]

**MY OPINION:** [2-3 paragraphs of direct, opinionated analysis. NOT generic templates. Connect to Paul's specific situation:
- His OpenClaw/Clawdbot instance
- His existing projects (Agent Fleet Dashboard, WingBot, etc.)
- His skills and assets
- What this means for HIM specifically
Be direct — say "skip" if overhyped, call out hype without substance.]

**Opportunity:** [One clear sentence describing the build opportunity]

**What it would take:** [Concrete steps to build this. Not vague — specific technical approach, integrations needed, MVP scope.]

**Difficulty:** [Time estimate: "2-3 weeks for basic version" or "Weekend hack" or "Multi-month if we want X"]

**Priority:** [Emoji rating + reasoning]
- 🔴 BUILD NOW — time-sensitive, validated demand
- 🟡 Add to backlog — worth doing but not urgent  
- ⚪ Monitor — watch how ecosystem evolves
- ⛔ Skip — overhyped or not worth the effort

---

[Repeat for each signal - aim for 5-10 quality items]

## 🧭 Pattern Summary

## Voice Guidelines

1. **Be direct and opinionated** — "This is overhyped" or "This is the real deal"
2. **Connect to Paul's stack** — Always tie back to OpenClaw, his projects, his situation
3. **Include real numbers** — Views, likes, followers, funding, users, parameters
4. **"What it would take"** — Be specific about the build, not vague
5. **No generic templates** — Every MY OPINION section should be unique analysis
6. **Call out hype** — If something sounds good but isn't, say so
7. **Prioritize actionable** — Skip interesting-but-useless signals

## Priority Criteria

**🔴 BUILD NOW:**
- Multiple independent sources validate demand
- Time-sensitive window (trend, launch, announcement)
- Paul has existing assets that give him an edge
- Clear revenue path

**🟡 Add to backlog:**
- Solid opportunity but not urgent
- Needs more validation
- Bigger build requiring planning

**⚪ Monitor:**
- Emerging signal, not clear yet
- Depends on ecosystem evolution
- Wait and see

**⛔ Skip:**
- Overhyped with no substance
- Crowded market with no differentiation
- Doesn't fit Paul's skills/interests
- Liability or regulatory concerns
