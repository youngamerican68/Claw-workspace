## Analysis Guidelines

1. **True convergence** = Same underlying pain point or opportunity identified independently
2. **False convergence** = Surface-level keyword match without real connection
3. **Prioritize** opportunities where:
   - Multiple Twitter accounts mention it
   - Multiple podcast guests discuss it
   - Paul has existing assets that give him an edge
4. **Be specific** about the build — not "AI tool" but exactly what it does
5. **Include Paul's advantage** — his OpenClaw instance, landing pages, existing projects
