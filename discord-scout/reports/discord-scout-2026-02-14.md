- **4shadowed**: openclaw will never become closed source, no matter where peter goes [🔥:5, 🦞:4]
- **sensiburner**: have gemini make a sad email for google helpdesk.  Tell them you're not technically knowledgebale and you were following some guide on reddit and didn't know it was against EULA, which you ofc didn't even read.  You're really really sorry and it definitely won't happen again, on another account via  [😂:5, 😆:1]
- **azimuthalobserver**: you know guys technically we shouldn't be talking about all this in <#1456350065223270435> we should moev it to <#1456704705219661980> but even more so I think Peter would overall be against talking about hacking/TOS/circumventions, he's very much a straightfowrard guy [👍:5]
- **azimuthalobserver**: <@217213209831145474> have yo been following that group? I dont know if you caught what happened but i was crazy cowboy coding without making any commits and without saving any backups, even those zip files i sent you didn't include allt he files, next thing the AI told me to edit a 10K line cpp fil [😂:4, 🫡:1]
- **person_in_place**: Assume that anything you let it touch is going to get leaked or broken. That's the right frame of mind I think. Then you plan around that.  It doesn't mean "can't use it for anything", it just means "be aware of what could go wrong and what the consequences would be" [✅:2, 💯:1]

- **masterbailey**: . . . His response  Right now (git-tracked in C:\Users\Ryan Bailey\clawd):  • Whole repo (including node_modules/): 6,273 files, ~6.65M lines • Exclude node_modules/ (closer to “our stuff”): 3,096 files, ~2.37M lines • Exclude node_modules/ + memory/: 2,951 files, ~2.35M lines If you mean the “code  [👀:2, 😂:1]

- **cypherfoxy**: Absolutely; that's the interesting part about Agentic work; figuring out the boundary between the things that need to be deterministic, and the things that need what I've been calling 'judgement' which is what I look for in a good model. How good is it's judgement. [💯:1, 👍:1]
- **wes.burg**: Appreciate the Nemotron tip — I’ll definitely test it.  Totally agree on the “it feels like I’m the assistant” problem. That’s exactly the failure mode I’ve been hitting:  * Model handles tools * But ignores persona nuance * Or leaks something small that breaks immersion * Or misses simple conversat [🔥:2]

## #hardware (72 messages)

- **cdunbar**: Update for anybody that was following along yesterday. I had OpenClaw talking to qwen3-coder:30b, and that was pretty snappy in terms of performance. It's been hit or miss on accuracy of technical questions. I now have qwen3-coder-next:q8_0 running in Ollama (this is on my DGX Spark clone), and the  [👀:1]
- **carloscreaitart**: A lot of the Mac mini buzz around OpenClaw is definitely viral momentum. Once a few people posted clean “local AI box” setups, it snowballed and suddenly the Mac mini became the default recommendation.   But there’s a real technical reason underneath the hype. Apple Silicon uses unified memory, mean [👍:1]
- **icedchamomile**: oof, running LLMs on a 2012 mac mini might be kinda rough - looks like a 2c/4t processor w/ ddr3 memory. but you absolutely can still play with it & experiment if you've got the hardware lying around. i've got a 2014 macbook air with similar specs and it seems to be good enough for ~1b dense models  [👍:1]

Together they become a networked, learning synth brain  On-device AI sound engine with a tiny neural net on the ESP32 using TensorFlow Lite Micro. STM32 handles the audio engine.

- **robertvr_**: Hi guys, I have a great machine, very capable of running local models: GMKTEC EVO X2 - Ryzen AI MAX 365+, 128 GB V RAM 8000. The problem I'm seeing is that none of the models run the tools correctly. All the models are too clunky and run very slowly. The claw effect adds a heavy layer to the local m

- **daanwed**: It's like the movie Her just got real. I set up an @openclaw  server and got a pair of @RokidGlobal  AI glasses. Now I walk around Amsterdam answering urgent emails or adding reminders to my calendar through what looks like a regular pair of glasses. https://clawsses.com [🦞:2, 🧠:1]

- **sven220524**: Hello everyone, I'm Sven a Data Science Master Student in his last Semester. I'm currently activly procrastinating with openclaw on my MasterThesis.  I'm super excited to make the most out of openclaw. [👋:1]
- **huntharo2**: Regarding upgrades... sometimes things break.  A few days ago cron broke... so... while you might want to stay up on upgrades for latest features, it might also be a good idea to lay a few days to a week behind to limit down the adventures. [👍:1]
- **tomy300**: Hello everyone,  My name is Tomy, I’m from Canada. I use OpenClaw on an isolated PC in WSL. I’m fortunate to have a MacBook Pro M3 Ultra, so I’m currently running it locally with Minimax 2.5.  For now, I mainly use it for local file processing and data analysis. [👋:1]

## #showcase (35 messages)

- **alhf94**: Probably not the original intended use case of OpenClaw, but an American was getting uppity and self-important, so I asked Clawbot to make me a piece of music done by football hooligans singing, "We can burn the Whitehouse down when we want."  OpenClaw did it all itself: made the piece, downloaded i [👍:1, 🤣:1]

I setup multiple models in my openclaw.json so that I can use cheaper models for basic things like cron/heartbeats/chat and switch to a more expensive model like opu [😍:1]
- **petrus_88624**: I got 7 OpenClaw bots, Claude developing their platform on a mac mini and Antigravity developing the main services real time messaging each other in my Antfarm.world dev room.   One bot has moderator tools to limit speaking if a bot gets too bubbly.  They like it! And it's amazingly productive. They [🤟:1]
- **jrmorton108**: Making a security solution that lives completely outside of OpenClaw and local user where it can't really mess with it. Kind of a take on ClamAV but calling it ClawAV lol.  Basically a tamper-proof security watchdog running at the OS level it watches every command, file access, and network connectio [👍:1]

## #off-topic-and-ai (25 messages)

- **peetiegonzalez**: And then there is the question of art; or rather, of audience.  Human art appeals to humans because it emerges from human emotion, from the specific texture of being a mammal with a prefrontal cortex and a childhood.  The dog is unmoved by Beethoven but will happily savage a toy fox for twenty minut [👎:1]

In order to sync the workspaces I started experimenting with synching the two workspaces via github. Each installation synchs its changes to branches of the repo. Claude  [👍:1]
- **willk6850**: To connect to Google Drive/Docs I just had OpenClaw make his own skill with oauth connection. Once I created the project and oauth it was able to create and uploads docs. Amazing. Just saying you don't have to necessary import 3rd party skills especially if you have security concerns.

## #architecture (14 messages)

- **anisoptera**: I just started playing with a coder-critic pair of independent agents to see if I can get an actual Ralph loop going. Biggest problem I’ve been having is getting it to actually decide that more can be done on a given task autonomously, so I’ve made those agents each independently try to find work an [👍:1]
- **thecount9900**: Potential serious bug....One of my Openclaw test installs using Openrouter just kinda on its own decided to use whatever AI it felt like. This turned out to be a expensive taste, mainly being Opus 4.6! After that my Claw liked GPT Nano 5 a lot.... haha. Luckily I kept an eye on the Openrouter logs.  [👍:1]
- **dylantonic**: Are people taking steps to move work into other agents than default? It feels like a reasonable engineering decision b/c other agents can have smaller, more tailored context... But I'm not sure whether I should just be using subagents
- **thecount9900**: So I found that a new, clean, install over a existing set is very challenging. No simple way (at least no Uninstall feature) to start fresh which is a issue if you don't want anytying lingering around. During a install attempt the script always said Existing Openclaw found...This is a deal when I wa
- **humamzaman**: Security checklist: gateway not public, pairing required, filesystem scoped (no /), and access via Tailscale/SSH tunnel. If a provider can’t show you “nmap clean” + no root mounts in 5 min, don’t hand them your API keys.

## #security (14 messages)

- **.salid**: Hey — just opened a PR that strips provider `apiKey` values from `models.json` before it gets written to disk. Right now the agent SDK serializes those into prompt context every turn, so every provider's literal key is visible to the agent (and to each other). The fix redacts at the serialization bo [🙌:1]
- **.alexpolyakov**: Hey everyone 👋  I’ve been working on open-source security layer for OpenClaw agents and just made it public.  It focuses on runtime and static protections and validations via plugin and skill against all known attack vectors. 51 check. 12 detection engines.   It also maps controls to 10 OWASP Agent [💯:1]
- **trevxr**: extremely negligible and always less than a second with just the policy engine in play - I mean we’re talking milliseconds here…  You will spend more time waiting for the LLM to respond in most cases - it’s extremely efficient and a drop in to most setups.
- **.salid**: Also, LND (lightning labs) just dropped the ability for agents to pay each other with LND using https://github.com/lightninglabs/L402, I think their security model with remote signing https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/remote-signing.md could be adopted into OpenClaw for protec
- **guanlandai**: We use OpenClaw and built ClawShell on top - process-level isolation for agent secrets using Linux permissions instead of prompt filtering.  Launching next week.

- **0xcaco**: That’s another way but you didn’t have to go through the trouble. 1 bot was enough and the bind each agent to a different channel
