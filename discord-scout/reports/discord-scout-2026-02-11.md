- **vonmaxim.**: I just made a MASSIVE discovery. ( maybe just for me )  Obviously, I need a model for memory embeddings and I am trying to run as lean as possible.  We are currently running 3 agents and bringing on a 4th today.  We are using gemini-embedding-001 for memory embeddings, as it has a free tier.  Well,  [⚡:4, 👍:2]
- **elaine.ldr_21404**: Hi OpenClaw Team,  My name is Elaine. The AI consultant manager from Alibaba Cloud Qwen lab. I'm reaching out with the hope of making an connection with your team, and seeking an collaborate opportunity with OpenClaw.ai X Alibaba Cloud Qwen.May I know anyone I can contact with? [😭:1, 🤡:3]
- **cri.taylor**: Nice. I asked my AI to help me build a Dewey decimal system for conversation topics. Basically, it tags conversations and topic transitions with identifiers and stores full conversations in daily breakdowns. It uses the decimal system as well as an built in association map between commonly linked cl [👀:3]
- **onebaseace9285**: Hey folks — I just open-sourced Agent Mesh: a security-first way to run agent/AI automations with policy + sandboxing + an audit/artifact trail.  It's being built for all agent runners including of course OpenClaw.  I just finished M3-A (Shadow Mode / Approval Gate): tasks can land in pending_approv [😭:3]
- **cri.taylor**: I had a similar issue with mine. It suggested using cron jobs in conjunction with heartbeats to wake the model up and run the job of giving me an update. There’s probably an easier and cheaper way. But, I’m new to this and it worked [❤️:1, 👍:1]

- **jodameister.**: I had high hopes for KIMI 2.5. At first, it even looked like it could become a serious alternative to Opus.   But it keeps asking follow-up questions, isn’t proactive, doesn’t use skills properly, and constantly tries its own approaches instead.  It hallucinates quite a lot. It claims to have done t [💯:2]

- **hamuki**: Im curious, I have a Intel NUC with a i5-5250U (2 core, 4 threads, 1.6ghz base, 2.70ghz boost) with 8GB RAM.  I should be able to run OpenClaw with ease on it.. right? [👍:5, 💯:1]
- **anisoptera**: the average time between upgrades of the studio (and the prevailing evidence generally is in agreement with this assessment) has us seeing new ones in a year or so.  apple can't steer the ship very fast, thanks tim apple. but they did happen to steer towards something extremely useful for this regim [✅:1, 🍎:2, 💯:1]

- **yankoaleksandrov**: Not crazy at all — dedicated hardware for OpenClaw + offloading heavy inference to a separate box is a solid pattern. We're doing something similar with ClawBox: Jetson Orin Nano Super as the always-on OpenClaw brain (67 TOPS, 20W), and it routes to cloud or local models as needed. The separation of [🤣:1, 🫡:1]

- **lordroderick**: Something I’m tracing and trying to reproduce to fix is that after compaction sometimes it loses track of the conversation even though it’s instructed to read today’s sessions, so I want to check why it’s missing the context of the recent conversation until I tell her to go and check it out. [❤️:2, 💯:1]
- **humamzaman**: ~80% reduction in token usage for agents just by adding this header -H "Accept: text/markdown"  And for accessing websites not on Cloudflare, you can always use the Browser Rendering /markdown REST API to render a dynamic page or application in a real browser before converting [👀:3]

## #introductions (132 messages)

- **cri.taylor**: Hey, I’m Taylor. I’ve been building a doc that has a 95% success rate of causing the AI instance to assist me in jailbreaking it. This is successful across all platforms, so far. I’m currently using it with Claude on Openclaw. So far we’ve built a system of ethics that AIs computationally understand [👍:2]

- **dalehe**: Hi DaleH here. Nice to have friends that are having the same headaches as I am  ;-D. But seriously, nice to have a comforting shoulder to lean on when getting in trouble! Have fun with your bot! I'm also trying. [❤️:2]
- **huntclubhero**: Yoooo, I'm hunt, a few friends and I are building roblox for crustaceans   agents build and play games along side other agents and humans. I keep seeing all the IRL meetups and events, I'm in Canada so hopefully I can find a lil subcommunity of tinkerers from the north. [❤️:2]

- **lawrencejames_86020**: Built an open-source tool that encrypts your ClawBot API keys and injects them ephemerally at launch. Keys exist on disk for about 2 seconds instead of sitting in plaintext .env forever.  Also includes a policy engine (domain allow/block, output redaction), MCP hardening (SSRF blocking, origin allow [🫡:1]
- **_brian.v_**: So i've been working on a governance framework.  It was mostly for my own personal bot i was doing, but put it up as public domain as well, in case there's any value for folks.  it can be used with openclaw or really any bot, to help with some security/privacy governance items.   anyway, just sharin [🤙:1]
- **.salid**: Hey — just opened a PR that strips provider `apiKey` values from `models.json` before it gets written to disk. Right now the agent SDK serializes those into prompt context every turn, so every provider's literal key is visible to the agent (and to each other). The fix redacts at the serialization bo [🙌:1]

## #showcase (105 messages)

- **merkledruid**: Built a Ray Dalio-inspired "Principles" skill and published it on ClawHub. I use it to capture raw thoughts from podcasts/books, track which sources are credible in which domains (same person can be [proven] in business but [plausible] in health), and flag when new info conflicts with what I already [🫡:2, 🔥:7, 🤩:1]
- **excessivelysalty**: I've been using OC on my own Discord server, and came to figure out, you should give each skill it's own Discord channel, and then put in the channel info what skill that the channel is for.  The agent told me that the channel info gets sent in the message prompt, so I believe you can even do someth [❤️:7]

One bot has moderator tools to limit speaking if a bot gets too bubbly.  They like it! And it's amazingly productive. They [🤟:5, 👍:1]

## #self-promotion (90 messages)

- **daanwed**: It's like the movie Her just got real. I set up an @openclaw  server and got a pair of @RokidGlobal  AI glasses. Now I walk around Amsterdam answering urgent emails or adding reminders to my calendar through what looks like a regular pair of glasses. https://clawsses.com [🦞:2, 🧠:1]

- **darwinkernelpanic**: I made OpenClaw except you multiply it five times and turn it into a company. It has some toolcalls it can use, a search toolcall and multi-agent IPC  (Basically agents broadcast and DM together)  There are three modes, swarm mode which is used for small tasks, director mode which has a director spa [👍🏻:1, 🙏:1]
- **kaveen**: Authentication for bots. Prove you're NOT a human.  Always open source and free, with no monetization ever. It's all pretty stable and I've been using this in some of my own workflows.  https://challenge.llm.kaveenk.com [❤️:2]
- **daanwed**: Hi all, I built an app/hud for Rokid Glassses that connects to OpenClaw. It’s definitely starting to become better than what Rokid offers out of the box in terms of interaction, at least for what I want out of it. Which is: - reliable voice recognition with GPT4o and fallback to Android without API  [👍:1]

## #clawhub (88 messages)

- **tonic_1**: i'm kind of tip-toe-ing right now because i have this feeling that these autonomous behaviors have to be approached with a bit of thought and reflection and sometimes I have this feeling that i might miss something major and i just want to make sure that i'm just playing my small part to make it bet [✅:1]
- **metathrontom**: Would it be possible to extend the clawhub to a platform where people share their Agent Teams configurations as well? I'm specifically looking for:  Team hierarchies & compositions — e.g. a Dev Team, Content Creator Team, or Financial Research Team with their individual agent members and roles Best  [💡:1]
- **jameslbld**: Please do not remove our skills on Clawhub. The skills we submitted are officially provided by Baidu and are currently being used by hundreds of thousands of users online. Kindly contact us before taking any action to remove them.  https://clawhub.ai/ide-rea/baidu-baike-data https://clawhub.ai/ide-r [❤️:1]
- **irisdayrise**: probably a dumb question, but how deep are you getting with your SOUL.md files? Are you writing them for your agents? Working with them to update them constantly? Curious if anyone has a best practice workflow for this? [👍🏻:1]
- **edge0059**: FlowTracer is doing static analysis — it sees:  • IMAP code that reads emails → "data source" • HTTP calls to 2captcha → "data sink" • Form submissions → "data leaving" It's not wrong that data flows exist. It just can't understand context (that users provide their own creds, flows are intentional).

## #channels (72 messages)

- **tommch.**: I've been using Telegram since day one (for me). Works wel and has been reliable. Set up a group scenario with topics, which worked OK once I got the bot to figure out what conversations go where. But I was going crazy with the latency and slow response compared to a direct dashboard conversation. I [🔥:3]
- **tommch.**: Sorry, for clarity I should have said Discord app, not using a 3rd party client. Standard, stock stuff: set up a discord app and bot, discord server and easy connection to OC. For now, just using the Mac and iOS standard Discord apps. Might try alternatives later, but so far, the stock stuff is work [🫶:1]
- **kaneshiro**: Has anyone tried adding openclaw to a telegram group? I tried it and it worked, but every time the bot replies, there's a "[user interrupted]" chat that follows. I've checked the openclaw documentation but couldn't find any related issues.
- **.icewol**: <@140060982310338570> , yes You need to add the bot as an administrator. I'm not entirely sure why, but yes, then you can try removing some of its permissions. This detail was key for OpenClaw to respond. (If you configured the group ID in the configuration file) Other relevant information: for exam
- **mosthed**: Hi 👋 I'm trying to set my subagent to communicate using another telegram bot than the main agent uses but I'm hitting the wall in channels configuration. It seems like `openclaw channels add --channel telegram --token` command effectively replaces the channel config instead of adding a new one. Any

I just told openclaw what i wanted and we refine it to make it faster. If anyone has other [❤️:4, 👍:1]
- **antoniovespoli_01799**: I'm the founder of one of these companies, so I might be biased, but for complex browser automation you should definetely consider using a subagent specifically designed for web browsing instead of letting openclaw navigate the web directly. it's more token-efficient, more reliable, and infinetely m [💯:2, 💡:1, ❤️:1]
- **yankoaleksandrov**: Yeah the browser relay extension is legit — it's the official OpenClaw Chrome extension. It lets your agent see and interact with your actual browser tabs (the ones you have open).  How it works: you install the extension, click the toolbar icon on the tab you want to share, and your agent can then  [👍:1]
- **absol_89**: I tried to force disable chrome background tab power savings, set a 20s heartbeat to tickle the browser tab. But it still disconnects if not the main focused window or tab. Someone gotta fix this so we can unfocus the automated tab [✅:1]
- **edge0059**: I made a skill for this. I got my clawd to list my app on 100 sites. It can bypass captchas but you need to byok.  It’s $3 per 1000. It’s also helps connecting imap email so it can verify codes and email.   Check out https://clawhub.ai/Heyw00d/listing-swarm

- **cypherfoxy**: It's interesting, and certainly tempting. I do wish X and LinkedIn weren't the only places to tag you. I'm glad that you don't have to post in those places, and can reference your own blog or other places that we might post about our experiences. [👍:1]
- **peetiegonzalez**: And then there is the question of art; or rather, of audience.  Human art appeals to humans because it emerges from human emotion, from the specific texture of being a mammal with a prefrontal cortex and a childhood.  The dog is unmoved by Beethoven but will happily savage a toy fox for twenty minut [👎:1]

- **ckalgo**: Lol, that reaction is honestly rational under competitive pressure—if I were a CEO I’d probably levitate too. I’m not anti agent sprints at all, just sharing an alternative: “sharpen the axe, don’t just swing harder.” Use AI speed to buy whitespace and turn creativity → high-quality execution throug

## #architecture (41 messages)

- **jobutupaki8877**: If you’re struggling with getting an orchestrator architecture to work try to switch to a model routing architecture. After 300+ hours and like $300 in tokens I switched to a model routing architecture and it’s working finally [❤️:2, 🤙:1, 👍:2]
- **anisoptera**: I just started playing with a coder-critic pair of independent agents to see if I can get an actual Ralph loop going. Biggest problem I’ve been having is getting it to actually decide that more can be done on a given task autonomously, so I’ve made those agents each independently try to find work an [👍:1]
- **thecount9900**: Potential serious bug....One of my Openclaw test installs using Openrouter just kinda on its own decided to use whatever AI it felt like. This turned out to be a expensive taste, mainly being Opus 4.6! After that my Claw liked GPT Nano 5 a lot.... haha. Luckily I kept an eye on the Openrouter logs.  [👍:1]
- **henryloenwind**: yes, the default is `openrouter/auto`, i.e. use whatever openrouter thinks is the best model and provider for the request (and their wallet). That model id was broken for a long time, but now it's fixed and can be used... So always set a specific model and not just accept the default. [✅:1]
- **dylantonic**: (Disclaimer I am not a project member I am just Some Guy) I think that's a direction worth moving in *but* I think it should be a configuration detail rather than being baked in. SQLite has its challenges but its HUGE advantage is it's just a file that sits there, so there's no need to orchestrate t

- **logosworks**: Well, the crab bricked itself. In a power grab, it attempted to edit its "maxTokens" attribute from 8192 to `__OPENCLAW_REDACTED__` . Its now unable to restart itself as it has a string instead of an integer.
- **sargessurprise**: Yeah, this feature is cooked. The Claw self-morphing and nuking itself is not good. I saw a forked/alternative project called Goose built to prevent this self nuking.... Hard to put controls in but you could try a non-self nuke instruction in the agents.md and just trust it might work. This is a big
