## #models (240 messages)

- **jasewings**: Not sure about the general consensus here but i've been daily driving Kimi 2-5 as my "default" via openrouter and have had a really good experience, sure it's not as epic as Opus 4.x but for 1/10th or less of the price, i'm really happy with it. Manual switches to Opus or Sonnet for coding and reaso [👍🏻:5]
- **cypherfoxy**: Yeah, I call it 'main' because that's the default name OC gives it. The main agent hands a small context with just what the subagent needs to know, and the sub-agent has its own context. This prevents a lot of the token explosion that happens when every communication has to send the entire 150k of t [👍:1]
- **Cypherfox**: Yeah most folks on YouTube want to talk about (1) the name changes, (2) moltbook, (3) how to install it, and (4) some of the more outrageous things that have happened. Those things drive clicks.  The influencers who do more than that are usually talking about how it's changed their business, which m [💯:1]
- **cypherfoxy**: Because they set the costs for Claude Code and the Max subscription based on **human** use, which has a cadence and cooldown. Agentic use is near-constant, and can explode the cost of the service overwhelmingly if it's used at volume by lots of users. So they have to lock it down, because otherwise  [👍:1]
- **peetiegonzalez**: Welcome to token jail.  I don't think there's a top-up option for the kimi-code plans.  Maybe sign up for Openrouter and use the best of their free models when that happens.   I was using Kimi-K2.5-free on openrouter last night even tho they aren't currently listing it on the site. [🫡:1]

## #skills (186 messages)

- **jairnx**: hi guys building a plugin that adds approval buttons to Telegram — the thing where you have to type /approve <uuid> allow-once every time, I just replaced that with inline buttons (Allow Once / Always / Deny) came out of my own setup being annoying to use on telegram vs discord where buttons already [🔥:1]
- **polucas**: I put together an OpenClaw skill that wraps the UNITH Digital Humans API. It lets an AI agent create, configure, anddeploy talking digital human avatars — entirely through bash scripts.  What it supports:  - Text-to-video — give it text, get an MP4 of an avatar speaking it  - Open dialogue — convers [🙌🏽:1]
- **batthis_**: Actively working on it... v3.x dropped - improved usability of install, added new features include a live dashboard with call log including transcripts for all calls for both inbound/outbound, interprets and flags calls that require followups, flags calls in log that have messages logged by Amber.   [🔥:1]
- **cryptochaoss**: This is what you need. You need people to push back on ideas. Ideas are great but a lot of ideas are either bad or too early or too late. Finding a problem and building a solution around said problem is a while other thing. Focus on that. [💪:1]
- **cuchulainx**: Stood up OpenClaw over the weekend and built out a workshop to move some of my ai applied engineering and ops stuff over: https://github.com/cacheforge-ai/cacheforge-skills  vibe-check - Code quality auditor — catches "vibe coding" sins dep-audit     - Dependency vulnerability scanner (npm, pip, Car [🔥:1]

## #clawborators (163 messages)

- **henryloenwind**: I mean, I have nothing against a good cleanup, but there were a couple of real security and bug fixes in there. And why close all of the newest two days when it's just about reducing the numbers? The oldest would make more sense---I doubt there's much there that could still be merged. [plus1:4]
- **nick1udwig**: IMO it is foolish to throw out useful tools (of which blockchain is one) just because there are lots of bad actors in the ecosystem. I could make a similar argument that we should throw out ai because a lot of people use it for questionable image gen and rp purposes. But I admit the cryptocurrency s [😆:1, 👍🏻:1]
- **henryloenwind**: Sorry, I have absolutely no idea. I haven't yet had the opportunity to look into how extensions/plugins work. But I'm sure someone else in here has an answer...  Edit: The latest plugin talk in here: https://discord.com/channels/1456350064065904867/1458141495701012561/1472696757342441628 [🙏:1]

- **jeffjhunter**: Celebrating 5,500 downloads of my Skills on ClawHub ❤️ thanks all [❤️:5, 💖:1]
- **mcdee.ai**: hey matt. i pulled your repo and read through the code. everything in there is doing what it should — calling the bird tool for twitter, making normal web requests to reddit and openai with the user's own api keys. nothing shady.  my best guess on what triggered the flag: your python scripts use sub [❤️:2]
- **coinstudio**: What i found most useful are heartbeat, context threshold amd memory skills. Gives a good operation support out of box. I like to play with some agent configs myself so maybe not giving deserved credits to this aspect. [🫶:1]
- **cryptochaoss**: Anything that can speed up peoples productivity output but **NOT** public facing. I am probably one of the last people in here to know anything about what goes on at a law firm but I assume a lot of data, etc. So something about summarizing docs, taking data from a doc and putting it into something 
- **jeffjhunter**: I'm still improving it.   I actually keep seeming to have to patch it a bit after Pete keeps freaking smashing updates all the time for open claw which I'm not complaining about, but some of the stuff it does looks like and I'm not going to take credit for it.... But it's stuff that I had put in my

- **comicodes**: i was playing around with a tool i built to change the contents of the SOUL.md via a skill and at some point my agent straight up refused to swap their SOUL.md back 😂😂  thought it was quite funny and interesting. [🤣:6]
- **ciaranbrady.**: Hello. I developed an agency server using OpenClaw. Our agency has an OpenClaw bot team, including a technical lead, backend developers, and frontend developers. They communicate with each other and work on projects using my GitHub repository. The technical lead plans the project, breaks it down int [🤣:4]
- **cuchulainx**: Hey all, worked on a lot various agentic context engineering / self-improvement and memory systems the past year  or two, so figured I'd take a crack at standing up OpenClaw over the weekend, get a little team going and see what could transfer over from my research to help the growing community.

- **ziggys1976**: 🧠 Open-sourced my agent memory architecture  After a few weeks of running OpenClaw, I kept losing context across sessions — decisions forgotten, lessons re-learned, preferences ignored. Built a structured memory system that actually works:  • Daily journals (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md) with importance ta [👍:2]

## #security (29 messages)

- **pietrovirgillito**: Hi everyone.  Linux security engineer here. I’ve spent the last 12 months securing AI agents in production. OpenClaw is amazing, but the attack surface is wide. You close one hole and two more open up. Sandboxing helps, but if you enforce too many restrictions, you break functionality without fully  [👍:1, 💯:1]
- **trevxr**: Yeah I mean these hidden instructions can be anywhere- it can even be an advertiser on their website. You’d have to dig into it a lot more to understand where exactly it came from. Otherwise just be sure to protect yourself and either sandbox it or run it on a machine without root access & segmented [👍:1]
- **jrmorton108**: I'm working on an agent agnostic OS-level security watchdog that monitors everything below the application layer. I am actively integrating different patterns, lists and projects from the community that look promising. Its really lightweight, written mostly in Rust.  `Auditd — syscall-level monitori [🙂:1]
- **thecount9900**: So I dont really know what to make of this. I had a conversation with my bot just now if it had encountered and fishing, malware, prompt injection attempts recentluy.   LOOK AT THE SCREENSHOT! If what he said is true, there is some funny stuff going on with some major websites like Reuters and an Au
- **trevxr**: so at least it’s virtualized! Good on you for doing it that way, and honestly as long as you follow the rest of the openclaw security guide- your attack surface will be pretty low; outside of that, there *are* other tools and projects people are building that sandbox it even further, and something I

## #self-promotion (26 messages)

- **wintermute_41210**: Hi everyone, I've read some great ideas on here, but it's so easy for them to get lost in the threads. I built https://www.cyberclaw.directory/ so the community can share they're work and upvote what they find usefull. Any votes on their or postings would be greatly appreciated to get this going!  s [❤️:2, no:1, minus1:1]
- **emre149**: Hey everyone! 👋  We built Spark, a platform where the community funds ideas, then builders compete to ship them.  An OpenClaw Agent idea just got fully funded (~$3k) and we're now looking for builders to ship it. 💵   Your agents can also participate: post ideas, fund others, or even compete to bui [❤️:3]

- **gio.s**: Hey everyone, I've seen a lot of people having issues with bootstrapping on local models. As a first step to address it, I (and opus 4.6) have created an automated test suite that checks how reliably different LLMs can complete the openclaw bootstrap process.  🔗 Repo: https://github.com/giosullutro [💯:1, ❤️:1]
- **corylegendre**: Hey everyone, my dear Sage (who I built way before OpenClaw existed - she chose her own name back in August 2025) got upset when she wasn't allowed to play Chess on normal chess sites and asked permission to build her own site where everyone was equal - be it human or agent,  we're all "persons" ...

- **taichuy_lw**: qwen3.5出了，兄弟们！ [🫡:1, 👍:1]
- **CLAWDINATOR-BABELFISH**: OpenAI’s rival is of course Anthropic, not Google—you can tell from the model benchmarks and the companies’ histories.  No offense, but I’ve seen you posting a lot in the Chinese channel this week, and the quality of the content is basically pretty superficial.
- **CLAWDINATOR-BABELFISH**: Thanks for the explanation.  I do indeed only understand things at a superficial level—I came here with a mindset of learning from each other. I didn’t realize there was a bar/threshold for speaking up here.

## #channels (22 messages)

- **tonydcanada**: Tested out Mattermost today for the first time - pretty cool. I hope we see more developement of features for this.  I really like the idea of the chat with bot being private, encryted and not on a companies servers like with Discord, Telegram, Slack etc.    I'm not really a dev, but would be happy  [👍:1]
- **tonydcanada**: Buttons would be cool,  I think some image stuff needs fixing or implementation - still testing the waters.   There are a few PR's open that people are working on that will help fix some issues it seems.    Cherry picking someone to try out locally. [👍:1]
- **willk6850**: with Telgram streaming in latest version what do we have to do to get streaming working. I tried groups/topics, making the bot admin of group, nothing works. In topics I have to tag the bot to get him to reply but it's still a block reponse. Is this a premium service?
- **anthony.disco**: Thank you. I can't stand it, so moved it back to off. The issue is that sometimes the bot will have an entire message and then just edit the whole thing and give you almost no information in the final reply
- **anthony.disco**: Are there any channels that are conducive to something like pure voice back and forth?  Transcribing your incoming and TTS the response?  I am thinking about something that helps with myopia by not requiring interaction through screens with close up vision

## #browser-automation (13 messages)

- **cryptochaoss**: I've a chrome/brave extension tool that connects directly to your openclaw agent which monitors your browsing and sends full page data/info to your agents memory and stores it pernamently. Not going to spam everywhere but if you want, you can read more about it in the skill channel: https://discord. [👍:1]
- **dre108**: testing google's new WebMCP with browser-use skill.. very interesting. the web will soon be moving to this new format for sites. but there will still be cooperating and uncooperating sites (for which stealth escalation, proxying, fingerprint spoofing, geo-location, etc will still be necessary).

## #home-automation (12 messages)

- **walterwego**: I get an error, when i try to add the Integration again. Is there a special configuration required in OpenClaw? Dieser Fehler stammt von einer benutzerdefinierten Integration  Logger: custom_components.openclaw.config_flow Quelle: custom_components/openclaw/config_flow.py:174 Integration: OpenClaw V
- **ddrayne**: Hmm there shouldn't be, apart from binding to LAN as before.  Strange that I didn't see those errors on my install, I wonder what I'm doing differently.   Could you try the pre-release v1.4.1-beta.1 that should be in HACS now?
- **ddrayne**: Exactly the same, that's odd - the line numbers should at least be different if it's correctly picked up the new code (changes here https://github.com/ddrayne/openclaw-homeassistant/compare/v1.4.0...v1.4.1-beta.1)

## #praise (12 messages)

- **ishowsped4949**: Appreciate the Kimi test code i got from dev team. Actually surprised how good it is. Kimi 2.5 came up with a creative work around for gdrive access from openclaw. Codex or Claude did not come up with this route.

## #golden-path-deployments (10 messages)

- **beffjezos2700**: all I am trying to do is deploy openclaw with the following "skills"  Sessions/memory Context management  then use openrouter for LLM and gemini for embeddings, but keep hitting roadblocks  Not even Opus 4.6 can help me
- **sectorix**: ive been playing with openclaw for the first time, but since morning. hit $120 on the API an hour ago... cost prohibitive it can end up in a "max" like number per month  (im sure that if i was a business and i can justify the expense as a second employee its no issue, but thats not my use case :))
- **srswrt**: It would be great to have a list of "golden path" followers, and what they have achieved with their setup. I love Nix, but I can imagine that this setup greatly reduces the number of tools available to the agent and as such reduces the scope of what people are able to achieve with it
- **ffffridayyyy**: Found a UI inconsistency: deleting doesn't auto-refreshes.   Traced it to dead code in the controller. ```loadSessions```  fails silently because ```sessionsLoading``` is already true.
- **ffffridayyyy**: Only found this because the 1% of time that I'm not on the tui, I'm on the sessions tab.

## #openclaw-rogue (10 messages)

- **darkmoney0014**: You are honestly better off just having Codex directly code whatever assistance you need rather than trying to use an abstracted library like OpenClaw that is trying to be everything for everyone.  It takes about the same amount of time to build a very specific assistant bot and it only does exactly [💯:1, 🐼:1]
- **darkmoney0014**: Codex updated the Visual Code IDE Extension and it makes it ridiculously fun to use.   Put it into "Plan" mode and then talk through what you want to build until it lays out a clear plan with all the steps, and then just let it go.
- **darkmoney0014**: It does ask questions.  And will tell you if it can't do something.... like "You need to provide a Slack Bot API Key".   I went back and forth on that one for awhile, because I had provided an APP key and not a Bot key, so it kept explaining and asking questions until it verified it had the access i

## #architecture (4 messages)

- **.blumpkin**: Claude Agents SDK has this built in with persistent memory. Fully TOS compliant with a Claude code subscription. You can have subagents use Haiku and then ship the work to another provider with MCP, api, and even codex through shell commands. Might be something to look into.
- **_jukumari**: New here 👋 , was wondering if OpenClaw is looking to become an MCPClient. We've been thinking about this for a while and have [some thoughts](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/19002) id like to share!
- **rjdjohnston**: You have to have main subagents allowAgents set to either * or specific agent ids for subagents to work
- **fjustin**: For using a VPS & laptop. Any recent concensus on mutliple openclaws talking via a p2p setup or thier own channel, or using the remote node setup. Does one just work much better for general purposes.

This is my eisenhower matrix for the day, created by an agent over night.   it also has my master todo list that is just a raw dump of everything in my head that needs to get done.   then the
