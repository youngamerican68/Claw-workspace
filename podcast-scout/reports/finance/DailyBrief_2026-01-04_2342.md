## 1. HIGH CONVICTION IDEAS

### Idea 1: Long Managed Futures (CTAs)

- **Trade Setup**: Broad Managed Futures exposure (e.g., CTA replication ETF or multi-manager fund), Long, 12-month horizon (2026)
- **Thesis (The WHY)**: Managed Futures (CTAs) are poised for a strong rebound in 2026, driven by an anticipated return to trending markets and significant macroeconomic shifts (e.g., higher rates, market dislocations). Their non-correlation to traditional assets and ability to profit from sustained trends, both up and down, makes them a critical portfolio diversifier, especially in a volatile environment. The recent underperformance has compressed expectations, setting the stage for outsized gains.
- **Consensus View**: The general market, particularly institutional allocators, views CTAs as an "unlikable strategy" due to recent underperformance and a lack of clear narrative around short-term recovery. Many allocators are anchored to traditional benchmarks and have minimal exposure (e.g., 50 basis points).
- **Our Edge**: The consensus view overemphasizes recent performance and misunderstands the cyclical nature and diversification benefits of CTAs. Andrew Beer highlights that "the space is going to make money a lot of money when the world changes a lot." Jim Kasang argues that "long volatility and it applies to other things in different ways are brakes on your race car, and the net result of removing the brakes from the car means everybody goes slower, because you're going to have turns and you can't go around those turns without brakes at full speed." CTAs provide this "control" and allow for faster overall portfolio returns when deployed tactically.
- **Signal Components**:
    - **Macro Shift**: Expectation of significant macroeconomic changes in 2026 (e.g., higher inflation, higher rates, credit crises, equity market volatility).
    - **Trend Resumption**: Anticipated return to sustained trends in various asset classes after a period of compression.
    - **Non-Correlation**: CTAs offer true diversification, especially during tail events when traditional assets are highly correlated.
    - **Mean Reversion in Performance**: Historically, challenging periods for CTAs are often followed by strong recovery years.
- **Catalysts**:
    - **Fed Rate Hikes**: Neil's prediction of a Fed rate hike in 2026 could trigger significant trends.
    - **Bond Market Breakout**: Alan Donnely predicts US 10-year yields up to 6% then down to 3.5%, implying massive bond market trends.
    - **Equity Market Volatility**: Mark Wessacinski forecasts "stable to down equity markets" and "bubble burst for our MAG 7." Jim Kasang predicts "2026 will in a lot of ways look like 2022. The pain trade will be market down, fall down and interest rates up." Such conditions are historically favorable for CTAs.
    - **Credit Crises**: Mark Wessacinski anticipates "some credit crises" carrying over into 2026, which would create market dislocations conducive to trending behavior.
- **Risks & Falsification**:
    - **No Sustained Trends**: If markets remain range-bound and lack clear directional momentum across asset classes throughout 2026, the thesis is invalidated.
    - **Continued Volatility Compression**: If the "percentage of winners has just shrunk below the break even point" (Marc Wessacinski) continues, CTAs underperform.
    - **Unexpected Market Stability**: If 2026 proves to be a year of low volatility and steady growth across all major asset classes, CTAs would struggle.
- **Implementation**: Invest in a well-diversified CTA replication ETF (e.g., one that tracks a broad CTA index) or a multi-manager fund. Consider a higher-volatility version if available and liquid, as Rob Carver suggests there is retail demand for "massive returns" and "massive outliers."
- **Supporting Quote(s)**:
    - Jim Kasang: "The one thing that is a true consistent diversifier, the most important thing in portfolio is a long volatility hedge."
    - Andrew Beer: "The space is going to make money a lot of money when the world changes a lot."

## 2. SPECULATIVE IDEAS

### Idea 1: Short MAG7 (Mega-Cap Tech) and Long European Equities

- **Trade Setup**: Short a basket of MAG7 stocks (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, GOOGL, AMZN, META, TSLA) and Long a broad European Equity ETF (e.g., VGK or EZU), 12-month horizon (2026).
- **Thesis (The WHY)**: The "Magnificent Seven" (MAG7) have driven disproportionate S&P 500 returns, but valuation compression and potential "bubble burst" (Mark Wessacinski) for these names are anticipated. Concurrently, Europe is expected to see a "resurgent" economic outlook and better fundamentals. This pairs a potential overvalued, concentrated segment of the US market with an overlooked, potentially undervalued international market.
- **Consensus View**: The market generally views MAG7 as continued leaders, driving US equity performance. While some acknowledge high valuations, the narrative of their dominance persists. International markets, particularly Europe, are often viewed with skepticism due to slower growth and geopolitical concerns.
- **Our Edge**: The consensus overlooks the potential for a significant re-rating of MAG7 stocks downward, driven by increased scrutiny of AI capex sustainability and a shift in market leadership. Mark Wessacinski explicitly predicts a "bubble burst for our MAG 7" and a "resurgent Europe," suggesting a non-consensus rotation. The observation that only two of the MAG7 outperformed the S&P 500 in 2025 (Google and Nvidia) despite the overall rally further supports the idea that the broader group may be losing steam.
- **Signal Components**:
    - **Valuation Compression**: MAG7 stocks, aside from Tesla, saw valuation contraction on a trailing 12-month PE basis from 2025 to 2026, implying that price appreciation did not keep pace with earnings growth.
    - **AI Capex Scrutiny**: The significant dependency of S&P 500 returns on a small number of AI-linked companies (65-75% from 42 companies) creates a concentrated risk.
    - **European Resurgence**: Mark Wessacinski explicitly predicts a "resurgent Europe" in 2026.
    - **International Under-ownership**: Joe Weisenthal notes that "no one cares" about international stocks despite 30-35% returns in 2025.
- **Catalysts**:
    - **MAG7 "Bubble Burst"**: Mark Wessacinski's prediction for 2026.
    - **AI Capex Stumbles**: If the "AI capex story somehow stumbles or changes" (Josh Brown), it directly impacts the core growth narrative of MAG7.
    - **Interest Rate Hikes**: Neil's prediction of a Fed hike could disproportionately impact growth-oriented MAG7 names.
    - **European Economic Tailwinds**: Unspecified "house in order" (Mark Wessacinski) in Europe leading to stronger growth.
- **Risks & Falsification**:
    - **Continued MAG7 Dominance**: If MAG7 stocks continue to deliver outsized earnings growth and maintain or expand their multiples, the short leg will be unprofitable.
    - **European Underperformance**: If Europe fails to gain momentum or faces new headwinds, the long leg will be unprofitable.
    - **AI Narrative Strengthens**: If the AI capex story accelerates and broadens beyond the current concentration, MAG7 would likely continue to outperform.
- **Implementation**: Short a basket of the seven largest US tech stocks (e.g., via single stock shorts or a leveraged inverse ETF if available and liquid for MAG7) and long a broad European equity ETF. Consider a pair trade to manage overall market exposure.
- **Supporting Quote(s)**:
    - Mark Wessacinski: "We're going to see some of the bubble burst for our MAG 7, which is such a high weight in the S&P 500, that's going to put a pale on all equities. The positive side, we'll see a resurgent Europe."
    - Josh Brown: "65 to 75% of S&P 500 returns profit and capital spending since the launch of chat GPT have been derived from 42 companies linked to generative AI."
- **What's Missing**: While the thesis is strong, the exact timing and magnitude of the MAG7 "bubble burst" and European "resurgence" are uncertain. Specific triggers for these events are not fully detailed beyond general macro shifts. The degree of "resurgence" in Europe is also not quantified.

## 3. MONITORING THEMES

### Theme 1: High Volatility CTA Products for Retail Investors

- **Why Interesting**: Rob Carver suggests an untapped market for "high vol ETF product" aimed at retail investors who "want massive returns," "massive outliers," and "things that are going to go up and down a lot." This contrasts with the institutional trend towards lower volatility CTA products. The idea is that retail investors are attracted to the potential for high returns, even with increased risk, similar to their interest in crypto and meme stocks.
- **Why Not Actionable**: This is a product development idea rather than a direct trade. Its success depends on regulatory approval for such products, market appetite for leveraged/high-volatility CTA exposure in an ETF wrapper, and the ability of product providers to manage the inherent risks and investor expectations.
- **What We're Watching**:
    - **Regulatory Developments**: Any signs of increased regulatory openness to leveraged or high-volatility alternative ETFs for retail.
    - **Product Launches**: The introduction and market reception of new, higher-volatility CTA ETFs.
    - **Retail Investor Behavior**: Continued preference for high-risk, high-reward assets (e.g., meme stocks, crypto) and their willingness to embrace more complex alternative strategies.
    - **Performance of Existing High-Vol ETFs**: How existing leveraged or inverse ETFs perform and if they attract significant retail flows.

### Theme 2: The Future of Enterprise SaaS in an AI-Driven World

- **Why Interesting**: The market is discounting enterprise SaaS companies (e.g., Salesforce, Adobe) due to the perception that AI will reduce the need for their services or human headcount. However, industry insiders believe AI could be a tool for efficiency within these companies, or that professional-grade tools will remain essential. This creates a potential divergence between market perception and fundamental reality.
- **Why Not Actionable**: The "narrative of this story is going to change 10 different times" (Ben Carlson) as the implications of AI on enterprise software unfold. It's unclear at this stage whether AI will be a net positive (efficiency tool) or negative (disruption/disintermediation) for these companies, or where the value will accrue. The specific impact on individual companies' profitability and market share is highly uncertain.
- **What We're Watching**:
    - **Earnings Calls and Guidance**: Commentary from Salesforce and Adobe on AI integration, customer adoption, and impact on revenue/profitability.
    - **Product Roadmaps**: New AI-powered features and how they are positioned to enterprise clients.
    - **Customer Adoption**: Evidence of enterprise clients using AI to replace or augment existing software, and whether this impacts their SaaS subscriptions.
    - **Competitive Landscape**: New AI-native competitors emerging or existing tech giants offering competing, integrated AI solutions.

## 4. Key Debates & Uncertainties

### Debate 1: Will the AI Capex Story Sustain S&P 500 Returns in 2026?

- **The Question**: Can the concentrated growth and capital expenditure in AI-linked companies continue to drive overall S&P 500 returns, or will this growth stumble, leading to broader market weakness?
- **Bull Case**: The AI revolution is still in its early stages, with massive investment and technological breakthroughs continuing. The 34% EPS growth in the tech sector, even with significant CapEx, demonstrates strong underlying fundamentals. AI will continue to be a powerful productivity enhancer across industries, justifying further investment and driving earnings. The market is not overpaying for these stocks, as "tech actually saw the largest valuation contraction" (Josh Brown) in 2025.
- **Bear Case**: S&P 500 returns are overly reliant on a narrow set of AI-linked companies (65-75% from 42 companies since Chat GPT launch). This concentration makes the market vulnerable to any "stumble" or "change" in the AI capex story. The "frenzied speculation" (Josh Brown) could lead to a bubble, similar to past tech cycles, which could pop. "The terminal value of this business [AI-driven tech] is a lot lower than it is today" if AI leads to commoditization or disintermediation of current leaders.
- **Critical Variable**: The sustainability and breadth of AI-related capital expenditure and its direct translation into broad-based, non-concentrated earnings growth across the S&P 500.
- **How to Trade It**:
    - **Bull Outcome**: Long SMH (VanEck Semiconductor ETF) and/or individual MAG7 stocks (excluding potential laggards like Apple/Tesla).
    - **Bear Outcome**: Short concentrated S&P 500 exposure (e.g., SPY or QQQ) and/or individual MAG7 names, potentially paired with long broader market (e.g., Russell 2000) or international equities.

### Debate 2: The Longevity of the Current Bull Market and Mean Reversion

- **The Question**: Given the high S&P 500 returns since 2019 (averaging 18% annually), is the market due for a period of mean reversion, or can strong earnings growth sustain these returns?
- **Bull Case**: The high returns are justified by strong underlying earnings growth, particularly in the tech sector. "If you're going to keep the earnings growth up somehow, then yes, then the answer is yes" (Michael Batnick). Bull markets can last longer than many anticipate, and the current economic strength, particularly among wealthy consumers, supports continued demand.
- **Bear Case**: "Can we keep doing this for this long where we have returns to this high in the market? That's the big risk" (Ben Carlson). Historical patterns suggest that extended periods of above-average returns are often followed by periods of below-average returns. The current high valuations, even if earnings growth is strong, make the market vulnerable to any slowdown. A "10 to 15% correction at some point due to profit taking and a growth scare" (Josh Brown) is anticipated.
- **Critical Variable**: The continuation of robust earnings growth that justifies current valuations and the absence of a significant economic slowdown or recession.
- **How to Trade It**:
    - **Bull Outcome**: Maintain long exposure to growth-oriented US equities, potentially diversifying into international markets which also saw strong performance in 2025 but remain relatively under-owned.
    - **Bear Outcome**: Increase allocations to defensive assets (e.g., Managed Futures/CTAs for diversification benefits), potentially reducing equity exposure or hedging with options.

## 5. Macro Sentiment Summary

- **Orientation**: Overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic on the surface, but with underlying concerns about market concentration, AI sustainability, and potential mean reversion after a strong run. There's a clear expectation of continued volatility and significant macro shifts in 2026.
- **Key Themes**:
    1. **AI Dominance & Concentration Risk**: The outsized role of a few AI-linked companies in driving US equity returns.
    2. **Managed Futures/CTA Rebound**: Strong conviction among specialists for CTAs to perform well in a changing, volatile 2026.
    3. **Mean Reversion in Returns**: Questioning the sustainability of high S&P 500 returns and the potential for a correction.
    4. **International Markets Under-ownership**: Acknowledgment of strong 2025 returns in international equities, but persistent lack of investor interest.
    5. **Inflation & Rates Outlook**: Expectations for continued inflation and potential Fed rate hikes in 2026.
- **Consensus Areas**:
    - AI is a transformative technology, but its specific impact on various industries (e.g., SaaS) is debated.
    - Institutional investors are slow to adopt alternative strategies like CTAs, often due to career risk and benchmark anchoring.
    - The restaurant industry faces persistent challenges with labor costs and supply chain volatility since COVID-19.
- **Divergence Areas**:
    - **MAG7 Outlook**: Whether these companies continue their dominance or face a "bubble burst."
    - **Fed Policy**: While some predict a hike, others like Jim Kasang anticipate a "pain trade" with interest rates up, suggesting a more hawkish stance than widely priced.
    - **Bitcoin Narrative**: Divergent views on whether Bitcoin will have another outperforming cycle and what its next dominant narrative will be.

## 6. Portfolio Actions

- **Immediate (This Week)**:
    - **Allocate to Managed Futures**: Initiate a position in a broad CTA replication ETF (e.g., KMLM or CTA). This acts as a diversifier against expected macro volatility and benefits from anticipated trending markets.
- **Tactical (Next 30 Days)**:
    - **Review MAG7 Exposure**: Evaluate existing positions in individual MAG7 stocks or concentrated tech ETFs. Consider trimming exposure to the weakest performers or those with minimal valuation support (e.g., Tesla due to its high and increasing PE multiple).
    - **Increase European Equity Exposure**: Begin building a position in a broad European Equity ETF (e.g., VGK or EZU) to capitalize on potential resurgence and benefit from international diversification.
- **Strategic (3+ Months)**:
    - **Monitor AI Capex Signals**: Establish a framework for tracking AI capital expenditure trends and their impact on corporate earnings across the S&P 500. Look for signs of slowing investment or a broadening of AI benefits beyond a few concentrated players.
    - **Assess SaaS Sector Re-rating**: Continuously evaluate enterprise SaaS companies (e.g., Adobe, Salesforce) for signs of AI integration success or continued market skepticism. A sustained rebound in these names could signal a shift in the AI narrative.
