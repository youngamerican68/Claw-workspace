The founders and leaders coming aren't talking about what AI might do someday. They're showing what it's already doing to their revenue, their teams, and their products right now.\n\nYou'll hear from founders who've gone AI-native and are growing 3x, 5x, even 10x faster than their competitors. Leaders who've deployed AI agents across sales, support, onboarding, and ops — and have the metrics to prove it works. CEOs who've completely rearchitected their companies around AI and came out the other side with better margins, faster growth, and smaller teams doing more than ever.\n\nWe're talking:\n\n→ How the best AI-native B2B companies are actually building and selling today\n→ Real demos of AI agents replacing entire workflows, not just summarizing emails\n→ What's working in AI pricing, AI-led go-to-market, and AI-first customer success\n→ How founders are competing when AI agents are disrupting their own categories\n→ The metrics that matter when your \"team\" is 3 humans and 20 AI agents\n\nAt SaaStr, we've lived this ourselves. We replaced most of our team with AI agents, went from -19% growth to +47%, and built AI tools that have been used over 750,000 times. So this isn't theory for us. It's how we run the business every day.\n\nWhether you're a founder trying to figure out where AI agents fit in your product, a revenue leader rethinking your GTM with AI, or an operator looking to 10x output without 10x headcount — this is the one event you need to be at this year.\n\n10,000+ B2B + AI founders, operators, and investors. Three days. The SF Bay Area.\n\nhttps://t.co/PBv85S5Cyt 2026",

For my setup, this prompt worked for me\n\nSince we might be on different versions, paste this prompt down below into your Clawd and say \"this prompt should help you upgrade to Opus 4.6. Check it over first to make sure it's compatible with our setup and won't break anything. Back up our config file\"\n\nHere is the full prompt:\n\nUpgrade me to Claude Opus 4.6. Follow these steps exactly:\n\nFind the model catalog file:\n\nfind /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/clawdbot -name \"models.generated.js\" -path \"*pi-ai*\"\n(On Linux, check /usr/lib/node_modules/clawdbot instead)\nIn that file, find \"claude-opus-4-5\". There are two entries (one with provider: \"anthropic\", one with provider: \"opencode\"). Add this block above each one, matching the provider field to whatever the 4.5 entry below it uses:\n\n\"claude-opus-4-6\": {\n    id: \"claude-opus-4-6\",\n    name: \"Claude Opus 4.6 (latest)\",\n    api: \"anthropic-messages\",\n    provider: \"anthropic\",\n    baseUrl: \"<https://t.co/G6axlxLkaj>\",\n    reasoning: true,\n    input: [\"text\", \"image\"],\n    cost: { input: 5, output: 25, cacheRead: 0.5, cacheWrite: 6.25 },\n    contextWindow: 200000,\n    maxTokens: 64000,\n},\n\nPatch the config:Use gateway config.patch with: {\"agents\":{\"defaults\":{\"model\":{\"primary\":\"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6\"},\"models\":{\"anthropic/claude-opus-4-6\":{\"alias\":\"opus\"}}}}}\n\nIMPORTANT: The config patch does a hot reload which won't pick up the catalog change. You need a full cold restart. Run: clawdbot gateway stop && clawdbot gateway start\nAfter restart, verify with session_status that you're running on claude-opus-4-6.",

Opus 4.6 is out. \n\nThis is what you need to do immediately if you want to escape the permanent underclass:\n\n• Upgrade your ClawdBot to Opus 4.6 NOW\n• Test out the new 'agent swarms' in Claude Code. Give more complex tasks than you normally do and watch how it spins up multiple agents\n• Give ClawdBot/Claude Code larger tasks. You now have a million token context window to play with. This means WAYYYY larger memory\n• Test out agentic search: have your ClawdBot scout the web. Ask it to find trends on Reddit you can make apps about\n\nWhen new tech drops, you have to take advantage of it. That's the only way to win\n\nPut your phone on Do Not Disturb and get to it",

One task at a time.\n\nYou babysit it through every step like a junior employee who needs hand-holding on everything.\n\nWe've been settling for AI assistants when we should be commanding AI teams.\n\nI've been testing @Spine_AI and it broke something in my brain.\nYou give it a goal and a swarm of specialized agents spins up automatically.\nOne researches. One plans. one executes. One cross-checks the others for errors.\n\nAll of it happening simultaneously on a visual canvas you can watch and control in real-time.\n\n300+ models working together. Not one chatbot pretending to be smart.\nThe cross-checking alone is wild. Agents validating each other's outputs means hallucinations get caught before they reach you. Not after you've already built on top of bad information.\n\nNo terminal. No code. No black box.\n\nYou're not managing a conversation anymore. You're managing an AI army.\n\nThis is built for people who do complex, multi-step work for a living.\nStrategists, researchers, analysts, ops leads. The thinkers.\n\nI don't hype tools often. But if their swarm intelligence roadmap lands the way the early version suggests, single-model chatbots are going to feel primitive within a year.\n\nThe Spine Swarm waitlist just opened. Spots are limited.\n\nGrab yours. Link in the comments.\n\n#SpineAI #AIAgents",
