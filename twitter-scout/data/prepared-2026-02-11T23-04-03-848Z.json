Now it's time to teach others.\n\nMy advice: build a personal brand demonstrating your workflows and/or look to consult other people still stuck on level 1 (local IRL is great at this stage)",

      "text": "On DeepWiki and increasing malleability of software.\n\nThis starts as partially a post on appreciation to DeepWiki, which I routinely find very useful and I think more people would find useful to know about. I went through a few iterations of use:\n\nTheir first feature was that it auto-builds wiki pages for github repos (e.g. nanochat here) with quick Q&A:\nhttps://t.co/DQHXagUwK0\nJust swap \"github\" to \"deepwiki\" in the URL for any repo and you can instantly Q&A against it. For example, yesterday I was curious about \"how does torchao implement fp8 training?\". I find that in *many* cases, library docs can be spotty and outdated and bad, but directly asking questions to the code via DeepWiki works very well. The code is the source of truth and LLMs are increasingly able to understand it.\n\nBut then I realized that in many cases it's even a lot more powerful not being the direct (human) consumer of this information/functionality, but giving your agent access to DeepWiki via MCP. So e.g. yesterday I faced some annoyances with using torchao library for fp8 training and I had the suspicion that the whole thing really shouldn't be that complicated (wait shouldn't this be a Function like Linear except with a few extra casts and 3 calls to torch._scaled_mm?) so I tried:\n\n\"Use DeepWiki MCP and Github CLI to look at how torchao implements fp8 training. Is it possible to 'rip out' the functionality? Implement nanochat/fp8.py that has identical API but is fully self-contained\"\n\nClaude went off for 5 minutes and came back with 150 lines of clean code that worked out of the box, with tests proving equivalent results, which allowed me to delete torchao as repo dependency, and for some reason I still don't fully understand (I think it has to do with internals of torch compile) - this simple version runs 3% faster. The agent also found a lot of tiny implementation details that actually do matter, that I may have naively missed otherwise and that would have been very hard for maintainers to keep docs about. Tricks around numerics, dtypes, autocast, meta device, torch compile interactions so I learned a lot from the process too. So this is now the default fp8 training implementation for nanochat\nhttps://t.co/3i5cv6grWm\n\nAnyway TLDR I find this combo of DeepWiki MCP + GitHub CLI is quite powerful to \"rip out\" any specific functionality from any github repo and target it for the very specific use case that you have in mind, and it actually kind of works now in some cases. Maybe you don't download, configure and take dependency on a giant monolithic library, maybe you point your agent at it and rip out the exact part you need. Maybe this informs how we write software more generally to actively encourage this workflow - e.g. building more \"bacterial code\", code that is less tangled, more self-contained, more dependency-free, more stateless, much easier to rip out from the repo (https://t.co/iKJUoHiIpl) \nThere's obvious downsides and risks to this, but it is fundamentally a new option that was not possible or economical before (it would have cost too much time) but now with agents, it is. Software might become a lot more fluid and malleable. \"Libraries are over, LLMs are the new compiler\" :). And does your project really need its 100MB of dependencies?",

When the post powerful personal AI ever came out (OpenClaw) what did the entire consumer market do?\n\nThey went out and bought Mac Minis\n\nThey laughed at the people recommending VPSs. \n\nThe normie doesnt want to run their personal assistant in the cloud. They want to run it locally. At home. On a personal device with their personal data. \n\nThey don't want tech execs reading their chat logs with their AI girlfriend. They want it private, on an easy to use, good looking device\n\nSoon the consumers will realize they want not only their agent local, but their intelligence local too\n\nAnd when they do do you think they'll run out and buy $3,000 Dell computers? No. They'll buy $10,000 Mac Studios. \n\nWhere all of this OpenClaw stuff is heading is so painfully obvious. You are just choosing to ignore the truth",
