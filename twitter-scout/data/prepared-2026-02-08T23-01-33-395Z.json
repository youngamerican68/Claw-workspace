      "text": "For the past 20 years, security models have been built around locking devices and applications down - setting boundaries between inter-process communications, separating internet from local, sandboxing untrusted code. These principles remain important.\n\nBut AI agents represent a fundamental shift.\n\nUnlike traditional software that does exactly what code tells it to do, AI agents interpret natural language and make decisions about actions. They blur the boundary between user intent and machine execution. They can be manipulated through language itself.\n\nI think everyone understands that with the great utility of a tool like @openclaw  comes great responsibility. \n\nDone wrong, an AI agent is a liability. Done right, we can change personal computing for the better.\n\nAfter speaking with @steipete and understanding more about the potential this project has - I've decided to spend a considerable amount of time and effort to jump in to help advise from security & trust perspective.\n\nWith that, we're officially launching the open draft of OpenClaw's trust program & threat model.",

That's his actual job.\n\nThis is a new career path for non-technical people, and a fascinating glimpse into where product roles are heading. I found myself thinking more deeply about the future of PMs, designers, and engineers during this conversation than I have in a long time.\n\nWe discuss:\n🔸 Why having no coding background can be a big advantage when building with AI\n🔸 His markdown file system that keeps AI agents aligned across complex builds\n🔸 What to do when you get stuck: Lazar's 4x4 debugging workflow\n🔸 Why you should be kicking off 4-5 parallel prototypes\n🔸 Why design skills, and taste, are going to be the most important skills in the future\n\nListen now 👇\n• YouTube: https://t.co/n6PHdRF6td\n• Spotify: https://t.co/iKuREcCKOk\n• Apple: https://t.co/d8Cow2eipa\n\nThank you to our wonderful sponsors for supporting the podcast: \n🏆 @strella_io — The AI-powered customer research platform: https://t.co/ot9eCM2jnG\n🏆 @Samsara — Saving lives with AI built for physical operations: https://t.co/7ZbhmWsz2U\n🏆 @WorkOS — Modern identity platform for B2B SaaS, free up to 1 million MAUs: https://t.co/XH3bKmeEkH",

The point is me being able to run a swarm of local AI agents powered by local AI models unlocks a world you can't imagine\n\nA world never discovered by humanity before\n\nRight now, as you read this post, I have multiple local AI models reading thousands of posts on X and Reddit\n\nHunting for challenges to solve\n\nThose local AI models are feeding hundreds of challenges a day to a manager model\n\nThe manager model (Henry) decides what the company (Alex Finn Global Enterprises) will build.\n\nThe company is constantly working.

I have an army on my desk. Never resting. Never eating. Never complaining. Always conquering.\n\nHere is your problem: it's not that you don't understand this. You don't want to understand this.
