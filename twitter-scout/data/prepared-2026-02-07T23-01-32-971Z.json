Morning industry briefing - AI reads 50 sources and gives you a 2-min summary before coffee\n2. Meeting notes > action items > follow-up emails automatically\n3. Monthly spending categorized and summarized without opening a spreadsheet\n4. AI reads your contracts and flags what actually matters\n5. Turn voice memos into organized notes, tasks, or blog posts\n6. Auto-generate social posts from one piece of long-form content\n7. Weekly meal plan + grocery list based on your diet and budget\n8. AI preps you before every meeting - who you're meeting, context, last conversation\n9. Summarize any PDF, report, or research paper in 30 seconds\n10. Auto-sort and label your files and downloads\n11. Turn YouTube videos into notes, summaries, or blog posts\n12. AI reviews your resume and tailors it for each job application\n13. Track your habits and get a weekly performance review from AI\n14. Draft customer/client replies in your tone of voice\n15. Turn a brain dump into a structured project plan\n16. AI reads your bank transactions and tells you subscriptions you forgot about\n17. Generate workout programs based on your goals and equipment\n18. Turn meeting recordings into SOPs for your team\n19. Auto-draft invoices from project completion\n20. AI monitors competitors and gives you a weekly update\n21. Translate and localize content across languages instantly\n22. Turn a rough outline into a full presentation\n23. Daily journaling prompts based on what's happening in your life\n24. Auto-categorize and respond to support tickets\n25. AI reads legal/tax documents and explains them like you're 10\n26. Build a personal CRM - AI reminds you who to follow up with and why\n27. Turn podcast episodes into show notes, tweets, and newsletters\n28. AI reviews your writing and matches it to a specific style or tone\n29. Auto-generate weekly team updates from project management tools\n30. Morning dashboard - AI pulls your calendar, priorities, weather, and news into one briefing\n\nPro tip: You can combine multiple of these and vibe code a dashboard on Claude to track all of your automations on one dashboard.",
