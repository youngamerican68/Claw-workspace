New vulnerabilities. That's what happens with any new tech. But security people sitting on the sidelines saying \"ha ha look at that garbage\" think they're being smart when they're actually getting left behind.\n\nYou can't just point fingers anymore. If you're too busy mocking AI to learn how to work with it, you'll get replaced by a sixty-dollar Anthropic subscription.\n\nThe acceleration is real.

I went into a great detail about the architecture and how everything is built.\n\nSo many people since then have been asking me to turn this into a product so that they can also use it.\n\nAnd I just did that...\n\nNow, I will go lock in and deliver this to everyone who trusted me with this and decided to join early.",
