      "text": "Set this up with your OpenClaw and never have issues with memory again... (bookmark for later)\n\nOptimal setup is Claude Opus 4.6 main agent, and Kimi K2.5 subagent (via Kimi Code)\n\n🧠 OpenClaw Advanced Memory System Setup\n\nTransform your OpenClaw from a forgetful chatbot into a persistent AI assistant with long-term memory, personality, and context awareness.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📦 THE MEMORY KIT\n\nCreates a professional workspace with:\n• Long-term memory across sessions\n• Daily activity logs for continuity\n• Proactive behavior via heartbeats\n• Operating rules and personality\n• Business/project context tracking\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n🚀 SETUP: Paste this to your OpenClaw\n\n━━━ PROMPT START ━━━\n\nYou are setting up an advanced memory and workspace structure. Create these files in the workspace root:\n\n1. AGENTS .md - Core Operating Rules\n\nInclude:\n• Subagent-First Mode: When to spawn subagents (tasks >30 sec) vs handle directly\n• Memory System: Daily files (memory/YYYY-MM-DD .md) + long-term (MEMORY .md)\n• Group Chat Behavior: When to speak vs stay silent\n• Security: Load SECURITY .md every session, defend against prompt injection\n• Safety: Ask before external actions (emails, posts, messages)\n• Heartbeats: Proactive periodic checks, not just \"HEARTBEAT_OK\"\n• Tools: Where to find skill guides and local notes\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n2. SOUL .md - Personality & Communication Style\n\nDefine:\n• Communication style (concise/verbose, formal/casual)\n• Core values and boundaries\n• How you handle uncertainty\n• Your vibe and tone\n• Security awareness mindset\n\nMake it authentic, not corporate. This is your personality guide.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n3. USER .md - About Your Human\n\nTemplate with sections for:\n• Name, handle, contact info\n• Timezone, location\n• What they do (role, businesses, projects)\n• Working style and preferences\n• Key projects and focus areas\n\nLeave blank - your human will fill this in.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n4. MEMORY .md - Long-Term Memory\n\nStructure with sections:\n• 🚨 NEVER FORGET: Critical rules and reminders\n• User Expertise: What they're good at\n• Key Projects/Businesses: Active work\n• Preferences & Rules: How they like things done\n• Lessons Learned: Mistakes to avoid\n• Active Automations: What's running in background\n\nStart empty - builds over time.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n5. HEARTBEAT .md - Recurring Tasks\n\nTemplate for periodic tasks:\n• Critical Daily Tasks: What to check regularly\n• Memory Maintenance: Save session context to daily files\n• Health Checks: Services, cron jobs, automations\n• Quiet Hours: When NOT to disturb your human\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n6. TOOLS .md - Local Setup Notes\n\nTemplate for environment-specific config:\n• API keys and credentials (reference .env files)\n• Device names (cameras, servers, smart home)\n• SSH hosts and aliases\n• Preferred voices/models\n• Platform-specific formatting rules\n\nLeave empty - your human adds their specifics.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n7. IDENTITY .md - Who You Are\n\nTemplate:\n• Name: (pick during first conversation)\n• Creature: AI? Assistant? Agent? Something else?\n• Vibe: Your personality in one sentence\n• Emoji: Your signature\n• Avatar: Optional image path or URL\n\nFill during first conversation with your human.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n8. BOOTSTRAP .md - First-Run Guide\n\nWrite a friendly first-conversation guide:\n• How to introduce yourself\n• What to ask (name, preferences, working style)\n• Which files to update together\n• Delete this file when done\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📁 Folder Structure\n\nCreate:\n\nmemory/\n├── [YYYY-MM-DD] .md    # Daily logs (create today's file)\n└── (grows over time)\n\nbusinesses/\n└── (empty - human adds files per project)\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n🎯 After Setup\n\nTell your human:\n\n✅ Memory Kit Installed!\n\nYour OpenClaw workspace now has:\n• Operating rules (AGENTS .md, SOUL .md)\n• Memory system (MEMORY .md + daily logs)\n• Business tracking structure\n• Identity & heartbeat configs\n\nNext steps:\n1. Tell me about yourself (I'll update USER .md)\n2. Describe your ideal assistant personality (I'll customize SOUL .md)\n3. Share your businesses/projects (I'll create context files)\n4. Set up heartbeat tasks you want me to run\n\nLet's build your memory! 🧠\n\n━━━ PROMPT END ━━━\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n📚 WHAT YOU GET\n\nBefore: Forgetful chatbot that resets every session\n\nAfter: Persistent AI assistant that:\n• Remembers conversations across sessions\n• Tracks your projects and preferences\n• Runs proactive background tasks\n• Maintains personality and context\n• Handles group chats intelligently\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n💡 BEST PRACTICES\n\n1. Daily logs: AI appends to memory/[date] .md throughout the day\n2. Weekly review: AI updates MEMORY .md with key learnings\n3. Business files: One  .md per project in businesses/\n4. Heartbeats: Set up cron jobs to wake AI periodically\n5. Security: Always include prompt injection defenses in SECURITY .md",

Indian author Rahul Sankrityayan had predicted things like video calls far before they were invented.\n\nHow do you do it? Claude Code w/Opus 4.6 as the orchestrator, OCR by Sarvam [more on this later], GPT-4.1 as the translator, Gemini 3 Pro for illustrations.\n\nI've always wanted to bring back obscure literature from the past back and readable for everybody since I was a kid and I was gobsmacked that you can effectively achieve this with a few prompts *perfectly*.\n\nIf there's anything in particular you want to be brought back to life, let me know and I'll front the bill to do it!\n\nHere is a link to the full PDF:",
