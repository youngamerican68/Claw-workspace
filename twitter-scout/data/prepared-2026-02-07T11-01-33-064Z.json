They have the best text-to-speech, speech-to text, and OCR models for Indic languages, and that's actually really valuable. The pricing is very reasonable. And the website is not only beautifully designed but dirt easy to use. They're filling a well needed gap in the ecosystem and doing things big labs will probably never focus on to the fullest extent (at least in the short term). I don't know anything about the business, but there's a lot to appreciate about what they've build technologically and I can't remember the last time I felt that way about software products coming out of India. Well done.",
