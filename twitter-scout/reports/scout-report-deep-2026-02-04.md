## 1. 🤖 Google AI Stack Acceleration — $400B Revenue & Gemini 3 Adoption Surge

**What:** Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced Q4/FY'25 results, revealing the company exceeded $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time. The standout detail: Gemini 3 adoption is faster than any previous Google model. The tweet from Matthew Berman (84K followers, AI YouTuber/investor) quoted Pichai's announcement, which has 4,314 likes, 383 retweets, and 243K views.

**How:** Google's "full AI stack" approach is fueling this progress. They're integrating Gemini across their entire product ecosystem (Search, Workspace, Cloud, Android) rather than treating it as a standalone product.

**MY OPINION:** Google's finally executing on AI in a way that leverages their core advantage — distribution. While OpenAI and Anthropic compete on model capabilities, Google is winning on adoption speed. For your stack, this validates that AI integration into existing workflows is the right strategy.

**Signal:** "Our full AI stack is fueling our progress, and Gemini 3 adoption has been faster than any other model in our history."

**Who said it:** @sundarpichai — CEO of Google/Alphabet (5.7M followers)

**Build idea:** A "Gemini-native" OpenClaw skill pack that leverages Google's AI stack

## 2. 🎯 AI Product Sense Education — Cursor-Based Interactive Learning Goes Viral

**What:** Lenny Rachitsky (297K followers) and his team spent 100+ hours building an interactive experience called "How to build AI product sense" that teaches essential AI concepts from inside Cursor itself. The content has massive engagement: 510 likes, 160K views, and 1,173 bookmarks.

**How:** The implementation uses Cursor's ability to open with pre-loaded prompts via URL parameters. Claire Vo engineered this "killer trick" using a workers.dev proxy that generates the appropriate deep link.

**Links:** https://x.com/lennysan/status/2018729619122499627, https://cursor-product-sense.lennysan.workers.dev/

**MY OPINION:** This validates two things: (1) interactive, embedded education beats blog posts, and (2) removing setup friction is a massive competitive advantage. You should steal this pattern: create shareable Claw workflows that open pre-configured in OpenClaw with one click.

**Signal:** "Most AI content is designed to induce FOMO and make you feel behind, not to actually teach you anything."

**Who said it:** @lennysan — Lenny Rachitsky, former Airbnb product lead (297K followers)

**Build idea:** Claw workflow share links that auto-configure OpenClaw with skills pre-loaded

**Difficulty:** 🟢 Weekend hack
