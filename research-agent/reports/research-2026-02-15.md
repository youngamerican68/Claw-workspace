## 🔥 Headline: OpenClaw Agent Teams RFC is Live

**The big news:** OpenClaw is planning native multi-agent orchestration. An RFC dropped on Feb 5 proposing "Agent Teams" — coordinated agents with shared task lists, inter-agent messaging, and parallel execution. This brings OpenClaw to parity with Claude Code's proprietary Agent Teams while keeping the open-source advantage.

**Why it matters for us:** Our Moltbook-as-a-Service landing page and multi-agent experiments are ahead of the curve. When this ships (targeting OpenClaw 2.x), we'll have first-mover advantage in documenting/teaching it.

**Key features coming:**
- `team_create` / `teammate_spawn` tools
- Shared task lists with dependencies (pending → blocked → claimed → completed)
- Mailbox for async inter-agent messages
- Cross-model teams (mix Claude, GPT, Gemini)
- Delegate mode for coordinator-only leads

## 🛠️ Tool Discovery: Clawe (Multi-Agent Coordination System)

Someone already built what we're experimenting with. **Clawe** is a Docker-based multi-agent system running on OpenClaw with:

- 4 pre-configured agents (Clawe, Inky, Pixel, Scout)
- 15-minute staggered heartbeats
- Convex backend for task management
- Web dashboard for squad status
- CLI for agents: `clawe task:status`, `clawe notify`, `clawe squad`

**How we'd use it:** Reference architecture for our Moltbook service. They've solved the infrastructure pieces (cron staggering, notification delivery, shared state) we were designing. Could fork/adapt rather than build from scratch.

## 🔒 Security: 28k+ Exposed OpenClaw Instances

**New threat intel:** SecurityScorecard STRIKE report (Feb 2026) found 28,000+ exposed OpenClaw instances. Common misconfigurations:

- Gateway bound to 0.0.0.0 instead of loopback
- No auth on web endpoints
- Default/weak agency tokens
- Exposed MCP server ports

**The explain-openclaw repo** has become the definitive security resource with:
- Hardening checklists for Mac mini, VPS, Cloudflare Moltworker
- 27 prompt injection attack examples
- Supply chain threat analysis (ClawHub marketplace risks)
- Model poisoning research (Microsoft, Feb 2026)

**How we'd use it:** Add VPS hardening checklist to our healthcheck skill. The `centminmod/explain-openclaw` repo has audit scripts we could adapt.

## 🔌 MCP Server Ecosystem Exploding

Model Context Protocol is becoming the standard for AI tool integration. Official MCP registry now lists 200+ servers across categories:

**Reference implementations:**
- `memory` — Knowledge graph-based persistent memory
- `sequentialthinking` — Dynamic problem-solving through thought sequences
- `fetch` — Web content fetching for LLMs
- `filesystem` — Secure file operations with access controls

**Notable third-party:**
- Browser MCP — Automate local browser (Puppeteer-based)
- Airtable MCP — Read/write Airtable databases
- 21st.dev Magic — Generate UI components
- Apple Notes/Shortcuts MCP — Talk to Apple ecosystem

**How we'd use it:** Our scouts could use MCP servers instead of custom scripts. Example: Instead of building a custom Twitter scraper, use an MCP server if one exists. Or build our own MCP server for the OpenClaw ecosystem and get distribution through the registry.

## 🛡️ VPS Hardening Quick Wins

Found a solid interactive hardening script and checklist:

**akcryptoguy/vps-harden** — Interactive Ubuntu VPS hardening:
- SSH key-only auth (disables password)
- UFW firewall with sensible defaults
- Fail2Ban for brute force protection
- Automatic security updates
- Root login disabled

**Anyone Docs VPS Hardening** — Comprehensive guide covering:
- BIOS/boot loader protection
- LTS release selection
- Docker security considerations
- Intrusion detection with AIDE

**How we'd use it:** Run the hardening script on our DigitalOcean droplet (if not already done). Add to healthcheck skill as an automated security audit.

## 📊 Synthesis: What This Means for Our Work

| Our Project | Research Impact |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Twitter Scout** | Could use MCP servers for data sources; consider exposing our scraper as an MCP server |
| **Moltbook Service** | Clawe is a reference implementation; Agent Teams RFC will be the official path — position as the "how-to" guide |
| **Landing Pages** | Security angle is hot (28k exposed instances) — opportunity for "Secure OpenClaw Hosting" LP |
| **Healthcheck Skill** | Integrate VPS hardening script and OpenClaw security audit from explain-openclaw |

## 🎯 Action Items

1. **This week:** Read the full Agent Teams RFC — identify gaps we can fill with content/tools
2. **This week:** Run VPS hardening audit on our DO droplet
3. **Next sprint:** Evaluate Clawe architecture for Moltbook service — fork vs build decision
4. **Backlog:** Build an MCP server for OpenClaw scout data (distribution play)
