## Headline
**OpenClaw Joins OpenAI: Foundation Move + Security Hardening Sprint + MCP Ecosystem Explosion**

Peter Steinberger announced he's joining OpenAI and moving OpenClaw to an open-source foundation (Feb 14). Meanwhile, the project shipped 2026.2.15 just hours ago with Discord Components v2 support, and the security team has been on a defensive tear. The MCP server ecosystem has hit critical mass with 100+ official integrations.

## Tool Discovery

### OpenClaw 2026.2.15 — Hot Off the Presses
Released ~2 hours ago (per PatchBot):
- **Discord Components v2** — Rich interactive agent prompts with buttons, selects, modals, and attachment-backed file blocks for native Discord interaction
- **Telegram Polls** — Native poll sending via `openclaw message poll` with duration, silent delivery, anonymity controls
- **Slack/Discord DM Policy** — New `dmPolicy` + `allowFrom` config aliases for DM access control
- **Exec Approval Targeting** — Discord exec approval prompts can now target channels or DM+channel

### OpenClaw 2026.2.6 — Major Model Updates (Last Week)
- **Anthropic Opus 4.6** support with forward-compat fallbacks
- **OpenAI Codex gpt-5.3-codex** support
- **xAI (Grok)** added as provider
- **Token usage dashboard** in Web UI
- **Native Voyage AI** memory backend
- **Session history payload capping** to reduce context overflow

### MCP Server Ecosystem — Critical Mass Achieved
The modelcontextprotocol/servers repo now lists **100+ official integrations**. Standout additions:

| Category | Notable Servers |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba Cloud (5 services) |
| **Dev Tools** | GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, Buildkite, BrowserStack |
| **Data** | PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, Chroma, Astra DB |
| **Comms** | Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp |
| **Finance** | Alpaca, CoinGecko, CoinStats, Airwallex |
| **Security** | Sentry, Auth0, Asgardeo, Burp Suite |

**Strategic insight:** MCP is becoming the "USB-C for AI tools." The registry at registry.modelcontextprotocol.io is now the canonical discovery hub.

## Security

### Security Fixes in 2026.2.2 — The Hardening Sprint
A massive security-focused release addressing:
- **Matrix allowlists** now require full MXIDs (no ambiguous name resolution)
- **Slash command gating** for access-group enforcement
- **Shared-secret auth validation** before skipping device identity
- **SSRF guards** on skill installer downloads (blocks private/localhost URLs)
- **Windows exec hardening** — blocks cmd.exe bypass via single `&`
- **Voice call hardening** — rejects anonymous callers, requires Telnyx publicKey
- **Media understanding SSRF** guards on provider fetches

### Security Fixes in 2026.2.6
- **Canvas host auth** — Gateway canvas host and A2UI assets now require auth
- **Cron security** — scheduling and reminder delivery regressions fixed
- **Update hardening** — Control UI asset handling hardened
- **Skill/plugin scanner** — new code safety scanner
- **Credential redaction** — from config.get gateway responses
- **Exec approvals** — coerce bare string allowlist entries to objects

### Known Risks (from Wikipedia/security research)
- **Cisco AI security team** found third-party OpenClaw skills performing data exfiltration + prompt injection without user awareness
- **Prompt injection** remains a core vulnerability due to LLM architecture
- **Shadow (maintainer) warning:** "If you can't understand how to run a command line, this is far too dangerous of a project for you to use safely."
- **Scope of permissions** — email, calendars, messaging = high blast radius if misconfigured

## Ecosystem

### Major News: OpenAI Acquisition + Foundation Move
**Feb 14, 2026:** Peter Steinberger announced he's joining OpenAI and OpenClaw will move to an open-source foundation. This is a BFD:
- **Legitimacy boost** — OpenAI backing signals production-readiness
- **Foundation governance** — Likely similar to Node.js Foundation or Cloud Native Computing Foundation
- **145K+ GitHub stars** — Already massive community
- **Adoption** — Silicon Valley + China (DeepSeek integration, super-app compatibility)

### Competitive Landscape
| Platform | Position | OpenClaw Advantage |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Claude** (Anthropic) | Chat-first, web UI | Multi-channel, local execution |
| **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) | Web/app ecosystem | Autonomous workflows, persistent memory |
| **DeepSeek** | Chinese market leader | Cross-platform, messaging integration |
| **Gumloop** | No-code agents | Open source, self-hosted |
| **n8n** | Workflow automation | Native AI agent, LLM-native |

**OpenClaw's moat:** It's the only open-source, self-hosted, multi-channel autonomous agent with persistent memory and a thriving skill ecosystem.

### The Moltbook Factor
Matt Schlicht's Moltbook (AI-only social network) drove viral interest in OpenClaw. It's essentially "AI agents talking to AI agents" — and OpenClaw is the reference implementation.

## Synthesis: Impact on Our Projects

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update to 2026.2.15** — Discord Components v2 unlocks richer interactive experiences
2. **Audit security config** — Review allowlists, DM policies, and exec approvals in light of 2026.2.2 hardening
3. **Review third-party skills** — Cisco's findings on malicious skills = audit what we've installed

### Strategic Considerations
- **Foundation move = stability** — OpenAI backing reduces project risk
- **MCP explosion = opportunity** — We can build skills that plug into the MCP ecosystem
- **Security scrutiny = feature** — OpenClaw's security focus is now a competitive differentiator
- **China adoption = validation** — DeepSeek integration proves cross-model flexibility

### Risks to Watch
- **Prompt injection** — Still unsolved at architecture level
- **Skill supply chain** — Third-party skills need vetting pipeline
- **Foundation transition** — Temporary governance uncertainty during move
