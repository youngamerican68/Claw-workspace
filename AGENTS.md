# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:
1. Run session recovery: exec bash /root/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/run-observer.sh --recover
2. Read SOUL.md — this is who you are
3. Read USER.md — this is who you're helping
4. Read memory/observations.md — cross-session memory from Observer agent (ALWAYS load this)
5. Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md for TODAY — daily context
6. Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md for YESTERDAY — recent context
7. Then run memory_search for additional context

Do not rely solely on semantic search — it may rank today's updates low.
Do not trust a single memory source alone — cross-reference observations + daily files.

## Memory

- **Daily notes:** memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md — raw logs
- **Long-term:** MEMORY.md — curated memories
- **Observations:** memory/observations.md — auto-generated cross-session memory (Observer agent)

Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember.
